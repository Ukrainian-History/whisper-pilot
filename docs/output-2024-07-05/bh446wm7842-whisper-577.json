{"text": " We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us... I don't know what it is exactly. It must be written somewhere. ...who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. We were the last family to be separated from America. I remember that because we have... ...newspapers and articles about how my parents were so lucky to have them in America. I think we were the last family. Because of that we had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letter that we were coming to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My mother took care of my child. My brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. And as we were the last family, then slowly there was the Hungarian Revolution. They started bringing Pögenik from Hungary. They invited us to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight years old. We stood there with American newspapers and greeted them. It was very exciting for me because I was so young. I was in a hotel somewhere. We talked very politely. We did interviews. I think that because we were the last family, we came to Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima. We had to stay in Irima. Because there was something wrong with the plane. I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then it was fixed again. I think we were there for a very long time. Maybe a month or something. And then we flew to New York. We didn't have the same number of flights. Then we took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small town in Luna, New Jersey. It's maybe three or four hours by bus from New York. Seabrook was a factory there. It was called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large house and a cooling factory there for over 30-40 years. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. It was done with a deep cooling of grass and wood. He needed a job. He needed a job in the summer months, when everything was growing. Before Estonians came there, the Japanese came there. Why did the Japanese come there? Because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were sent to the concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, when the Americans came to America, they started to fight there. They started to fight, but more likely, to ally with Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there. They had their own homes, their own houses. It was a kind of transportation. You don't know how Russian transportation was. They were sent to the concentration camps. They said, take what you can carry with you. They were in the camp for a few years. When the war ended, the children, you know, what they were looking for now, their homes and places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. They were deported or sold. Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. There was also Cyprus, because Cyprus gave them work and life. In the middle of the 50s, there were maybe 600 people. 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere, that at least 1,000 Estonians moved through there. Some people came there, only for a couple of months they moved on. Maybe you got contact with your family or some better job somewhere. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, there was food, there was laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy clothes, where they needed it. When I was growing up, my friends were both Japanese and Estonians. We were always the first in the class. We were always the first in the class. We had a very tough life in Estonia. You were in the school of Estonia Pühapäivä, which was held on Saturday, but you had a very strict component, but in Estonian, you had to practice singing in Estonian, rapha dance, Estonian culture. Estonian books, bags in Estonia, that was a big part of my life, to get bags in Estonia. I remember how they gathered the numbers, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas goods. Then, of course, the goods that we had grown up with, which were always in such a good condition, especially since it was me, and I finally had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. They opened a coffee shop, for sure. I don't know what else they went there. So, for a long time they planned how to get in there, and then finally the packing was done, and then there was a line around it, so that it would go to Kindel, and then to the address. I don't know if they had to go to Philadelphia, or I think they had to go somewhere far away where they could get it, where they could get it in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five months old, the first books of 54-55, I think, started to go back. I remember that my grandfather, Herman Merican, who was still living in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He wasn't Merican, he was Merikandi. Don't forget that he was my grandfather's relative, my grandfather, who was a police officer. And the books always went around, so that in the beginning, that book wasn't even for my grandfather. I didn't know who to write to, because I had the feeling that I didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. Someone who has been arrested, and who may have been a German soldier, or a policeman, or whatever. That's how I got in touch with them. The books were read, understood by my mother and grandmother, what was going on there, what was going on here, what was going on there, and they reminded me of Estonia all the time. And what always made me laugh was that my grandmother always had different memories. It was like that today. No, it wasn't like that. It was like that today. What do you know? You were so young then, you didn't remember anything. I don't know very well, but she was such a big communist, Russian, red-haired woman, and we were all red-haired. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was red-haired, communist, Russian, red-haired, that was also for sure. But my mother, well, she was 16 when she left. Plus, she has this thing, I've heard so much about it, that she was arrested, and she was killed right away, very quickly. One uncle was shot by a knife in Siberia. The other one, the one who was deported from home, he had three children, one was a boy, and that boy was shot in the head, and at least my mother told me that he was thrown out of the window and shot as a child. When you grow up, I remember friends with whom you grow up, who are not Estonians, Americans, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandchildren, they have grandchildren, you read children's stories, let's go to the grandchildren, let's see what old things there are. I didn't have these things, I don't remember this country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our memories, our old things, our relatives. There was a fire in Estonia, a house fire, for a person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You get off the ship, and then you see that there is... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel, but you do, don't you? And you're on this side, and you see through it, it's a straight line. And I immediately stepped there, and everyone was standing next to it. And I felt them all around me. I haven't seen them in my life, but I was raised with letters, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I was a reader, and it was like, don't you recognize the people you were raised with letters, but you haven't seen them in your life, but they are your own home.", "segments": [{"id":
