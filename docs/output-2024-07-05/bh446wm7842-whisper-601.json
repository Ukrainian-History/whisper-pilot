{"text": " We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. We were the last family that they took to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles about how my grandparents were so lucky that they were able to go to America. I think we were the last family. That's why. We had a name in the letter and we were told that we would come to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My mother had a child and my brother was born in November before that. I think it was really because of that. Since we were the last family, when the Hungarian revolution happened and they started bringing in refugees from Hungary, we were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We were staying in the US. We were wearing American flags and we were greeting them. It was especially exciting for me because I was so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We received a very nice response. We did interviews and so on. I think since we were the last family, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Irimaa. We had to fly over Irimaa because there was something wrong with the propeller. There was something wrong with the propeller. But then they fixed it again. I don't think we were there for too long. Maybe more than an hour or so. And then we flew back to New York. We don't have that ship number either. They immediately brought us a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Lona, New Jersey. It takes about three or four hours by bus. We took a bus from New York. We went to Seabrook because there was a company called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large farm for over 30-40 years. He had a cold factory there. It was the first cold factory in the US. It was built with a cold plant and a cold plant. It was built with a cold plant and a cold plant. And he needed a job. And he needed a job especially in the summer when it was winter. When everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there. The Japanese had come there. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese also put them in storage tanks. Because the Japanese who lived in America, because America was at war with Japan, they began to plow here. Or they began to plow here more. Maybe, you know, to connect with Japan. To do some kind of large jobs. Or I don't know what they did. They were Japanese who had lived there for years. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was mostly like moving. Not only, you know, like moving to Russia. Anyway, they put them in warehouses. They were told to take what you can carry with you. And they were in warehouses for a few years. And then when the war ended, then they were given, you know, go now. Live. Search. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been. They couldn't go back there anymore. Whether they had been liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them got alone. But basically it was like that. They had to start a new life. So they also came to Seabrook. Because Seabrook offered them jobs. And living. In the middle of the 1950s there were maybe about 600 people there. 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe got some contact with other relatives. Or some better job offer somewhere. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had such a good place there. When people came there, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside. There was a toilet. There was a toilet. All sorts of things were there. They were given. There was a pool where they could buy food that they needed. Welfare was there. And my friends were there when I was growing up. Japanese. And Estonians. And. We were like... Curious in school. We were always in the first grade. We had a very, very close relationship with Estonia. There was a school in Estonia called Pyhapäeva, which was open on Saturdays. But there was a church component, but also some Estonian practices. Singing in Estonian. National dance. A little bit of Estonian culture. And Estonian books. Packages in Estonia. That was a big part of my life. To get packages in Estonia. I remember how they collected them for several months. What to get. What Estonia needed. Someone asked if it was possible to get some overseas gifts. Then, of course, gifts from which we had grown up ourselves. Which were still in such a good condition. Especially since it was me. And finally I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Sibruk. Always a coffee pack. Definitely. I don't know what else went in there. So. For a long time it was planned how to put it in there. And then finally the making of the package. And then some kind of line around it. So that it would be solid. And then the address. And then one. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia. Or. I think I had to go somewhere far away. Where to get it. Where I could get it in Europe. Or get it in Estonia. When I was five or six years old. 54 or 55. I think the first books. I started to go back and forth. I remember that my grandfather. My grandfather Herman Merikani Öde. Who still lived in Tartu. His name had changed a little. He was called Merikand. He was Merikandi. Because. I didn't want to say. That he was my grandfather's relative. An old man who was a police officer. So. And the books always went. So that in the beginning. That book wasn't for my grandfather. You know. At some point. That you could name. To whom you really write. Because there was always that feeling. That you didn't want to make people poor. Who live in Estonia. That. Someone who has left. And. Who was maybe. In the German army. Or in the police. Or whatever. That it's like. Now in contact with them. These books. They were read. They were understood. My mother and grandmother. All the time. And. What was going on there. And thinking. Here. And. That was that test. And. And. And they reminded me. Estonian time. All the time. And. What always reminded me. Was that. My. I've always been. Some. A memory. And. It was like this. No. It wasn't like this. It was like this. What. You know. You were so young. You could remember. Something. I know very well. These things. This thing. With which I grew up. And. My mother was. Oh. She was so big. Communists. Russians. The joy of red things. And we were born to carry red. It was for sure. And. Everything. There was a world. But my mother was like, well, she was 16 when she was released. Plus, she had this thing, I've heard so much about it, that she had been deported. She was probably killed right away, very quickly. One dad died, and the tree where she was buried was broken. The other who was deported, there were three children, one of them was a mother, who died on a wagon. At least, my mother's story was that she was thrown out of the wagon when she died. When you grow up a refugee, I remember, friends with whom you grow up who are not Estonians, for example, Americans, they have grandparents, they have grandparents, they have fathers, they have grandfathers, We don't have any relatives. You read children's stories and say, let's go to Pöning and see what old things are there. I didn't have any of those things. We didn't have any old things anywhere. We only had the things we had when we came. We didn't have any old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our Pöning, our old things, our relatives. The fire in Estonia was a home fire. There was never a fire in Estonia, but it was a home fire. You get off the ship and then you see this... It wasn't a wheel, but wheels. And you're here and you see through it. It was like a spiral wheel. I immediately walked there and everyone was standing in line. Yes, I felt it. I took them all away. I hadn't seen them in my life, but I had grown up with books. Like my grandmother and grandmother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there and I said, think. There were Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti. And it was a pleasure to get to know people with whom you have grown up a little, but you haven't seen them in your life. But they are your own right now. Yes. I feel proud of myself. How great is that, right?
