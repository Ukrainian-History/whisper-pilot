{"text": " We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. Andra was an assistant, I don't know what it is exactly, it has to be written somewhere, who assisted the relatives and we were the last family they took to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my grandparents were so lucky that they have now come to America and the last family. And I think we were the last family, because we had to come earlier, we had our names written and heard that we were coming to America, my grandmother came a year earlier, but then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that, and I think the truth was that it was because of that. And since we were the last family, then later, when there was the Hungarian Revolution and Hungary began to bring these refugees, then we were invited to New York, I remember it so well. I was 7 or 8 years old. We were standing there with American flags and we were greeting them. It was especially exciting for me because I was so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We received a very nice response, we did interviews and so on. I think since we were the last ones, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Irimaa and we had to leave Irimaa I don't know if it was the propeller or something else that was a problem. But then they fixed it again and I don't think we stayed there very long. Maybe more than a night or something. And then back to New York. So we didn't have that ship either. Then they immediately brought the buses to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small town in Lona, New Jersey, and it's about 3-4 hours by bus from New York. Seabrook was founded by Charles F. Seabrook Farms. When I was 30-40 years old, I had built a large farmhouse and a cooling plant there. It was one of the first deep cooling plants in America. It was built with a deep cooling plant. And it needed work. Especially in the early summer months, when everything was growing and the Estonians had arrived, the Japanese had arrived. And because the Americans were at war with Japan, the Japanese also put them in storage. The Japanese who lived in the US, when there was a war in the US, they started to work here, or they started to work more with Japan, to do some kind of big jobs, or I don't know what they did. These were Japanese who had lived here for years, they had their own homes, their own houses. And it was more like a visit, not just a visit to Russia, you know. Anyway, they were put in warehouses. They were told to take what they could carry with them. They were in warehouses for a few years. And when the war ended, the children were told to go and live, to look for their homes and places where they had already been. They couldn't go back there anymore. I don't know if they were liquidated or sold, maybe some of them were, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. So they also came to Sibruk, because Sibruk offered them work and living. In the middle of the 1950s, there were about 600 people, 600 Estonians. From my point of view, I have read somewhere that at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through here. Some people came here only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe they got some contact with other relatives or some better job. But we lived there, I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good point of view there. When people came here, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside, there was a toilet, there was a toilet, all sorts of things. There was a well where they could buy food that they needed. There was a nursing home there. And my friends were also there when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. And we were there in school like beggars. We were always in the first classes. We had a very close relationship with Estonia. You are a member of the Estonian Holy Day, which takes place on Easter. But there is also a church component, but also a little bit of practice in Estonian. Singing in Estonian, folk dance, a little bit of Estonian culture. And books from Estonia, packages to Estonia. It was a big part of my life to get packages to Estonia. I remember how many months we spent together, what we could do, what we needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money from which we had grown up on our own, which was in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three grandchildren. These two girls were born in Seabrook. They always had a coffee bag. I don't know where they went to. For a long time they planned how to put it in there. Finally, they made a bag and put a rope around it so that it would be fixed and with an address on it. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia, but I think I had to go somewhere far away to get it, to get it back to Europe or to get it back to Estonia. When I was five or six years old, I think my first books started to go back and forth. I remember that my great-great-grandfather Herman Merikani Öde, who still lived in Tartu, Her name had changed a bit. She didn't call herself Merikand, she called herself Merikandi. I didn't want to say that she was my great-grandfather's relative, my great-grandfather was a police officer. And the books always ended up like this. In the beginning, the book wasn't meant for my great-grandfather. You know, at some point you were able to name the person you were going to write to. There was a feeling that they didn't want to hurt the people who lived in Estonia. Someone who had fled, who was in the German army, or in the police, or whatever. It is in contact with them now. The books were read, they were understood. My mother and grandmother were gathered. What was happening there, what was happening here. That was the trial. And they kept reminding me of Estonia all the time. And what I always had in mind was that my grandmother always had a different memory of things. She was like this today. No, she wasn't like this today, she was like this today. What do you know, you were so young, you couldn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know, such and such things. This is the story I grew up with. My mother was such a big fan of the communists, the Russians, the red stuff, and we were not allowed to wear red. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was the cause of the red communists, the Russians, that was also for sure. But my mother was there. She was 16 when she was released. Plus, she had this thing, I've heard so much about it, that her grandchildren were taken away. They were probably killed right away, very quickly. One of them died, and a tree fell right in front of her. The other, those who were taken away from her, she had three children, one of them was a mother. At least my mother's story was always that she was thrown out of the window when she was a child. When you grow up as an orphan, I remember the friends you grow up with who are not Estonians, for example Americans, they have grandmothers, they have grandfathers, they have dads, they have aunts, We don't have any relatives. You read children's stories and say, let's go to Pöning and see what old things are there. I didn't have any of those things. We didn't have any old things anywhere. We only had the things we had when we came. We didn't have any old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our Pöning, our old things, our relatives. The fire in Estonia was a house fire. It had never been in a person's life, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship. And then you see... I don't know if it was a wheelbarrow, but wheels. You're on this side and you see through it. It was a crane wheelbarrow. I immediately walked there. Everyone was standing in a row. I felt them all. I haven't seen them in my life, but I grew up with books, like my grandmother and grandmother, we used to read them all the time. I used to stand there and think. Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti. And it was very nice to meet people with whom you have grown up a little, but have not seen life, but they are your own place.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.0, "text": " We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952.", "tokens": [50365, 492, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 300, 1361, 490, 7244, 294, 10858, 17, 13, 51215], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.855133337133071, "compression_ratio": 0.9016393442622951, "no_speech_prob": 0.11359942704439163}, {"id": 1, "seek": 1700, "start": 17.0, "end": 27.0, "text": " Andra was an assistant, I don't know what it is exactly, it has to be written somewhere,", "tokens": [50365, 400, 424, 390, 364, 10994, 11, 286, 500, 380, 458, 437, 309, 307, 2293, 11, 309, 575, 281, 312, 3720, 4079, 11, 50865], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5978192891160102, "compression_ratio": 1.597938144329897, "no_speech_prob": 0.026950430124998093}, {"id": 2, "seek": 1700, "start": 27.0, "end": 33.0, "text": " who assisted the relatives and we were the last family they took to America.", "tokens": [50865, 567, 30291, 264, 18201, 293, 321, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 436, 1890, 281, 3374, 13, 51165], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5978192891160102, "compression_ratio": 1.597938144329897, "no_speech_prob": 0.026950430124998093}, {"id": 3, "seek": 1700, "start": 33.0, "end": 44.0, "text": " I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my grandparents were so lucky that they have now come to America and the last family.", "tokens": [51165, 286, 1604, 309, 570, 321, 362, 5242, 293, 11290, 295, 577, 452, 21876, 645, 370, 6356, 300, 436, 362, 586, 808, 281, 3374, 293, 264, 1036, 1605, 13, 51715], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.5978192891160102, "compression_ratio": 1.597938144329897, "no_speech_prob": 0.026950430124998093}, {"id": 4, "seek": 4400, "start": 44.0, "end": 48.0, "text": " And I think we were the last family, because we had to come earlier,", "tokens": [50365, 400, 286, 519, 321, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 11, 570, 321, 632, 281, 808, 3071, 11, 50565], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 5, "seek": 4400, "start": 48.0, "end": 53.0, "text": " we had our names written and heard that we were coming to America,", "tokens": [50565, 321, 632, 527, 5288, 3720, 293, 2198, 300, 321, 645, 1348, 281, 3374, 11, 50815], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 6, "seek": 4400, "start": 53.0, "end": 56.0, "text": " my grandmother came a year earlier, but then my mother took the child", "tokens": [50815, 452, 14317, 1361, 257, 1064, 3071, 11, 457, 550, 452, 2895, 1890, 264, 1440, 50965], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 7, "seek": 4400, "start": 56.0, "end": 59.0, "text": " and my brother was born in November just before that,", "tokens": [50965, 293, 452, 3708, 390, 4232, 294, 7674, 445, 949, 300, 11, 51115], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 8, "seek": 4400, "start": 59.0, "end": 62.0, "text": " and I think the truth was that it was because of that.", "tokens": [51115, 293, 286, 519, 264, 3494, 390, 300, 309, 390, 570, 295, 300, 13, 51265], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 9, "seek": 4400, "start": 62.0, "end": 66.0, "text": " And since we were the last family, then later, when there was the Hungarian Revolution", "tokens": [51265, 400, 1670, 321, 645, 264, 1036, 1605, 11, 550, 1780, 11, 562, 456, 390, 264, 38034, 16617, 51465], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 10, "seek": 4400, "start": 66.0, "end": 71.0, "text": " and Hungary began to bring these refugees, then we were invited to New York,", "tokens": [51465, 293, 32380, 4283, 281, 1565, 613, 18301, 11, 550, 321, 645, 9185, 281, 1873, 3609, 11, 51715], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.41125602396125466, "compression_ratio": 1.8314176245210727, "no_speech_prob": 0.3469235301017761}, {"id": 11, "seek": 7100, "start": 71.0, "end": 75.0, "text": " I remember it so well.
