{"text": " To sum up,anzo was late to the party. The hearing must also be passed on to the Chinese. We were the last family who, We left Germany in 1952.ametra was the assistant director of, I don't really know what it is exactly He was an assistant to public. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have photos and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. I think we were the last family, because we had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letters that we would be sent to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. I had a child and my brother was born in November. I think it was true. When we were the last family, there was the Hungarian Revolution. They started bringing us from Hungary. We were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight years old. We stood there with American flags and greeted them. It was very exciting for me. The first time I was in a hotel, we didn't talk much, we did interviews. I think we were the last ones. We were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Irima and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then it was fixed again, and I think we were there for a very long time, maybe more or less, and then we went to New York. So we didn't have the same number of ships. So we took the bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey, and it might be three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a factory called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook, for more than 30-40 years, built a large farm and a cooling factory there. It was one of America's first deep cooling factories, with a deep cooling of grass and wood. And they needed a job. And they needed a job especially in the summer months, when the weather was just right, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians came there, the Japanese came there. And why did the Japanese come there? Because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, When they were in the US, they started to mess around there. They started to mess around, but more or less, you know, to connect with Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there for a year. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was a kind of transportation, too. You don't know how Russian transportation was. Each of them was put in a camp. They said, take what you can carry with you. They were in the camp for a few years. And when the war ended, the children, you know, no longer wanted to live. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. Were they deported or sold? Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. You also came to Sibrok, because Sibrok provided them with work and life. In the middle of the 50s, there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. You may have had contact with your relatives or some better job. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, food, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place to live, where they could buy clothes. There was a clothing store there. When I was growing up, my friends were both Japanese and Estonian. We were always in the first classes of the school. We had a tough life in Estonia. You were at the Estonian Püha Päivä school, which was held on Laupäivä. But you had a literary component, but also Estonian, a little bit of practice, singing in Estonian, rafting, Estonian culture. And you wrote in Estonian, you packed in Estonian. It was a big part of life, to pack in Estonian. I remember how they gathered measurements, What could I get? What did I need in Estonia? Is it possible to get some extra income? Then, of course, the income from which I grew up, which was always in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. We opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what else went there. It took me a long time to plan how to get in there. And then finally the package was made, and then there was a line around it. It was like a line, and then you get on it. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia, or I think I had to go somewhere far away, where I could get the package from Europe or from Estonia. When I was five months old, I think the first letters of 1954-55 started to come back, I remember that my old father, my old father Hermann Merikan, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He was not a Merikan, he was a Merikandi. Don't forget that he was my old father's relative, and my father, who was a police officer. And the letters always went around like this. In the beginning, this letter wasn't even for my father. You know, somehow you can't really name who you're writing to. Because there was also the feeling that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. someone who had helped them, someone who was a German soldier or a policeman or whatever. That's how I got in touch with them. These letters were read and understood by my mother and grandmother all the time. What was going on there and what was going on there. That was the trial. They reminded me of Estonia all the time. What always made me laugh was that My mother always had a different way of remembering things. It was like that. No, it wasn't like that. What do you know? You were so young, you didn't remember anything. I don't know very well, you know things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was, oh, she was such a great communist, a Russian, a redhead, and we were all red. That was for sure. And all that was world, but what was the reason for the red communists, the Russian children, that was also certain. But my mother, well, she was 16 when she left. And plus, she has that thing, I have heard so much, that her ancestors were killed. The ancestors were probably killed right away, quite quickly. One uncle, Suri, and his uncle, Sibiris Otsa. There were three children in the house. One of them was a mother. The mother was wearing a scarf. At least my mother told me that she threw the child out of the window. When you grow up, your parents... I remember my friends who I grew up with, who weren't Estonians. Americans. They have old mothers, old fathers, They have parents, they have grandchildren, they have relatives, they have grandchildren. You read children's stories. Let's go up to the grandchildren and see what old things are there. I didn't have these things. We didn't have old things anywhere. We only had things that we had when we came. We didn't have old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our grandchildren, our old things, our relatives. There was a man in Estonia who had never been there, but he was a homeboy. You get off the ship and you see that there are... I don't know if you've ever ridden a wheel or a boat. You're on this side and you see through it. I quickly stepped on it and everyone was standing next to it. I felt like I had seen them in real life, but I was raised with books, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood up and started to read. There was Livi, Elmo, Kai, Mati. And it was like, don't you recognize the people with whom you grew up, who you may not have seen in real life, but they are your own bodies.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end":
