{"text": " We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us... I don't know what it is exactly. It must be written somewhere. ...who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. We were the last family to be separated from America. I remember that because we have... ...newspapers and articles about how my parents were so lucky to have them in America. I think we were the last family. Because of that we had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letter that we were coming to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. But then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. And when we were the last family, then slowly there was the Hungarian Revolution and Hungary began to bring Pögenik. We were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American newspapers and greeted them. It was very exciting to me because so young... The first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We talked very politely. We did interviews and so on. I remember when we were the last family. We came to Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima. We had to stop in Irima. Because there was something wrong with the plane. I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then we got better again. I think we were there for a very long time. Maybe above or something. And then we flew to New York. We didn't have the same number of flights. Then we took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey. It's maybe three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a job there, which was called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook, was over 30-40 years old. He built a big house there. And a cooling factory there. It was one of America's first deep cooling factories. They did it right away with a deep cooling. And he needed a job. And he really needed a job in the summer months. It was during that time when everything was growing. Before the Estonians came there, the Japanese came there. And why the Japanese? Because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the cooling factories. Because the Japanese who lived in America, because there were deaths in America, they began to die there. They began to die, but more likely, you know, to associate with Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was like sending. You just don't know how it was like sending a Russian. Every time they were sent to the camps, you had to take what you could carry with you. They were in the camp for a few years. And when the war ended, then the children, you know, what they were looking for now, and of course their homes and places where they had already been. They couldn't go back there. They were liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them got it, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. They also came to Cyprus. Because Cyprus packed their work and life. In the middle of the 50s, there were maybe 600 people. 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months, they moved on. Maybe they got in touch with their relatives or some better work. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live there. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture there, there was food, there was laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy food, where they needed it. There was clothing there. And my friends were, when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. We were there in school, we were always in the first classes. We had a tough life in Estonia. You were in the Estonian Holy Day School, which was held on Saturday. But you had a literary component, but also Estonian, a little bit of practice, singing in Estonian, dance, Estonian culture. And you wrote in Estonian, you packed in Estonian. It was a big part of my life, to be able to pack in Estonian. I remember how they gathered measurements, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas goods. Then, of course, the goods from which we were raised, which were always in such a good condition, especially since it was me, and there were three brothers. The two brothers were born in Zibruk. We started packing coffee, for sure. I don't know what else was going on there. So, for a long time we planned how to get in there, and then finally the packing was done, and then some rope was tied around it, so that it would be secured, and then on the table, I don't know if we had to go to Philadelphia, or I think we had to go somewhere far away, where we could pack in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five, six years old, the first books of 54-55, I think, started to come back. I remember that my old father, my old father Herman Merican, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. He had changed his name to Merican, because he didn't want to deny that he was my old father's relative, my old father, who was a police officer. And the books started to come back, so that in the beginning that book wasn't even for my old father. You know, it somehow made me think about who you were actually writing to, that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia, someone who has been arrested, and who may have been a German soldier, or a policeman, or whatever, that you were in contact with them. The books were read, understood, my mother and my old mother all the time, what was going on there, and what was going on there, and it was that trial, and they came to mind all the time and what always made me think was that my old mother always had different memories of things. It was like that. No, it wasn't like that, it was like that. What do you know? You were so young, you didn't remember anything. No, I know very well, I know some things. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was like, oh, she was such a great communist, I saw her in the red. That was certain. And all that was world, what was the reason for the red communists, the Russian children, that was also certain. But my mother was like, oh, she was 16 when she was released, and plus she had this thing, I have heard so much about it, that her parents were arrested, they were killed probably quickly, and she was sent to Siberia. The other one, the one who was sent from home, she had three children, one was a mother, and that mother was on the lapel, and at least my mother's story was that she was thrown out of the lapel window as a child. When you grow up, you are an old woman, I remember that, yes, friends with whom you grow up, who are not Estonians, let's say, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandchildren, they have grandchildren, you read children's stories, let's go to that grandchildren, let's see what old things are there. I didn't have these things, we didn't have old things anywhere, we only had things that we had when we came, we didn't have old memories of that country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our grandchildren, our relatives, so that... There was a fire in Estonia, one person who had never been there, but it was a fire in Estonia. You get off the ship, and then you see that there is... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel, but you are on a wheel, and you are on this side, and you can see through it, there was a big wheel, and I immediately stepped on it, and I felt all of them. I've only seen them in real life, but I grew up with these books, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I was a reader, there was Livi, Elmo, Kai, Mati, and it was like... Don't touch that book! People who... Some of you grew up with them, but you haven't seen them in real life, and you don't know who they are.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 6.0, "text": " We were the last family
