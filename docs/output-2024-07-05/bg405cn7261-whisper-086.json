{"text": " Okay, good. Thank you so much, Mark. My name is Amanda Whitmire. I am from the Miller Marine Biology Library here at Stanford Libraries, and I'm going to spend the next 10 minutes talking about student work and FERPA. And I nixed copyright because I only have 10 minutes, and there's a copyright person coming up in a bit later, so we won't worry about that for now. So FERPA is U.S. law, but I'm discussing it through the lens of a librarian at a marine research station with the intent of really just putting it on our collective radar as we move forward talking about archives and access. Over the next couple days. And just for context, my library is actually located at the Hopkins Marine Station, which is about 90 miles south of here, perched on the southern tip of Monterey Bay. Lucky me. So let's just get right into it. What is FERPA? So FERPA is a federal law that came in response really to a history of inconsistent institutional policies and improper disclosure of student information. So the intent of FERPA really is to protect. Privacy of both parents and student information. And what FERPA says is that institutions that receive federal funds have to provide parents with access to the educational records of their children, although this right transfers to the student once they turn 18. It prohibits releasing the educational records of students, other than directory information, without written consent, although consent is not required for release of the education records to certain institutions and organizations. Which is slightly confusing, right? So recall that I mentioned that directory information can be released without consent. So what is directory information? It's things that wouldn't be considered a violation of the student's privacy, which surprisingly includes things like place and date of birth, their photograph, if they're on an athletic team you can release their height and weight. So I'll leave it to you to decide how invasive you think these, this, you know, non-private information really is. And then recall also that consent wasn't required to release certain education records of students. Well what are those? FERPA defines those as being student works that are directly related to the student's process through school and they're maintained by the educational institution. And it could be handwritten assignments, digital media, and so on. Lots of different forms. So already this is pretty confusing and as librarians and archivists you're probably wondering, well what is the overlap between student work you might have in your collection and FERPA? What is considered an education record and might have to be collected and what is something that we can make available? And so ALA actually asked the U.S. Department of Education this question in 1993 and the Department of Ed clarified saying something like a thesis which a student gives to the library generally for the no-gap or the non-gap of the student's research. And the purpose of being made available as a research material, the process of the student giving their material to the library provides a form of tacit permission to make those materials available as research objects. So as we've seen the regulations concerning student work or educational records can be confusing but FERPA is important and our understanding of FERPA is important because I think students produce really important research that's critical to our understanding of the world and to the extent possible I want to be able to make those research materials available. And so for the next few minutes I'm going to give you an example of something that I've been navigating through my work recently to give you some context on on my thoughts on this issue. And it's it's gonna seem like a little bit of a tangent at first but stick with me it's all gonna it's all gonna come back together. So has anyone in this room ever used the Merlin Bird ID app or iNaturalist to identify something? Yes! Yes! My people! You're my people! Perfect! So when you take a picture of something and you upload it into Merlin or to iNaturalist what you're doing is you're collecting three pieces of information. I saw this thing in this place at this time and those three pieces of information together are called a species occurrence. And there's a place called GBIF, the global biodiversity information facility, that gathers species occurrence records from iNaturalist, from eBird, from academic research that's happening all over the world. And as it stands they have almost 1.4 billion records of I saw this thing in this place at this time. And why is that important? Well if you're interested in understanding things like how climate change might be shifting the distribution of animals and plants on the planet, you have to understand not only where they are now but where they were before. And that is the power of 1.4 billion observations in GBIF. So as one example say you're interested in knowing where this very common marine anemone can be found in the world, Anthopleura, and you go to GBIF and you take a look and see what they have, you'll see that there's almost 2,500 species occurrence records, which sounds like a lot of data. But if you take one step deeper into the data what you find is that the large majority of our records of this organism, and in fact the majority of all of the records in GBIF, are very recent. And if you're interested in looking at things on the scale of climate change you need to be able to look much further back in time. So how do we fill this observational gap? And that's where I think long-standing educational institutions like Stanford and others really are poised to make a significant contribution. And one area where I think we can make a contribution locally is through the undergraduate work of our students. So in particular I just want to give this one example of two students, Sara Gilman and Rafe Sagran. They came to Hopkins in the summer of 1993. And what they chose to do for their research project was to resample a transect that was first sampled in 1931-1999. 1933. So there's an intertidal line that goes from the shore out 105 yards. They finally found the line after three days, started by that brass bolt. They looked at 19 square yards along this line. They counted up all the species and they compared what they saw to what another researcher had seen back in the 1930s. And what they discovered was that there was a shift toward warmer water species. And along with a temperature time series that we also maintain at Hopkins, they hypothesized that this might be due to shifting ocean temperatures. And their student paper is in my library. So based on that work, they came back the following summer. They did more work. They identified over 58,000 individuals from 105 different invertebrate taxa. And again, they were able to, with this greater body of data, actually show a strong correlation between species shifts and changing ocean temperatures. And their work as undergraduates was published in the paper. And they were able to, with this greater body of data, not bad. But their work is just one paper in a much larger collection that we have in our library that expands from every year. The same class was taught from 1963 to 2011. And these are all of their unbound papers, which are now actually here on campus being digitized. But what you'll also find out is that my collection of student papers is not unique. So these are similar collections in Washington, up at Friday Harbor. Collection starts in the 40s, up at Bodega. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. And they're all digitized. Bodega Marine Labs, just north of us here, their collection starts in the 1920s. And both of these are ongoing. Here's a collection from Banfield Marine Science Center up in Canada, British Columbia. And when I reached out to my colleagues at other marine stations, what I found is there are literally thousands of undergraduate student research papers available for local use in our libraries. So if you're interested in exploring something like climate change for an intertidal species, this body of work is unprecedented in its coverage in space and time. And so I'm going to talk about that in just a moment. But what does this have to do with FERPA? You're all wondering, Amanda. And so what I discovered when I was working with my colleagues up and down the coast to assess the potential for creating just a federated catalog, let's get all the bibliographies of all these students' papers together, put them in one place. So if a researcher wanted to know just what's out there in terms of student research, can I find it? What I discovered is that in at least two cases of those libraries on the last slide, the librarians were limited in their ability to share bibliographies because of the institution's understanding of FERPA. So in the case in front of you here, the librarian was told she had to remove all of the student names, the student author names from the papers from the bibliography. This is our oldest collection. It goes back to 1928. So she had to remove all those names by hand. She was also told she couldn't put these in the library catalog. So what she did is she created a PDF, and she shares this on the library web page. And if you'd like to search it, you can use the control F to search her catalog of student research. In another case, the librarian was told, point blank, you can't put this bibliography online, period. It's an invasion of students' privacy. But you'll remember what the U.S. Department of Education said. When a student gives the work to the library, it's tasked with permission to share the work. I'm not talking about copyright. That's a totally separate issue, but it's perfectly acceptable to make the work available through the library. And their name is directory information. That's not protected. So there seems to be a lot of confusion about FERPA that's really limiting our ability as librarians to distribute content and make it discoverable in ways that we think are unacceptable. So I've been able to show you that there's potential that lies within student work and the impact that you can have, so that you might understand my frustration and my interest in FERPA. As a librarian, I feel a moral obligation to make critical observational research data and information available to researchers to the widest extent possible. Under the growing threat of climate change, siloed catalogs, or worse yet, catalogs that you can't even find are completely unacceptable as a status quo. And I know I don't need to tell you guys that. So we need new ways to discover and access the research hiding in our collections. And in the case of student works, this means that we have to understand the limits and the latitudes associated with FERPA. And that's why I wanted to share it with you today. Thank you.
