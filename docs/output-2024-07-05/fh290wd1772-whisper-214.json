Then Sam and Dean tried to explain, but he answered with a sigh. Oh, well, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. I don't care what becomes of me, but I have this much to say. Death molested you, I did to you, so I'll leave you here to paddle in your car. Oh, canoe, oh, well, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. Say, Virginia, the sand which you have so suddenly assumed is not in sympathy with the lines that you read in my autographed album years ago. What did I write? This. When the rocks and the rills, they divide up, and you never move. Oh, well, I see. Yes, remember, for your heartbroken baby who wrote these lines to thee. Did I write that? Mm-hmm.
