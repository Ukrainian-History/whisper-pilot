{"text": " We are the last family that came from Germany in 1952. Undra was the one who assisted the widower. We were the last family that they took to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my grandparents were so lucky to have been brought to America. I think we were the last family because we had to come earlier. There was already a letter that said that we had to come to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My mother had a baby and my brother was born in November, just before that, and I think the truth is that it was because of that. And since we were the last family, then later, when there was the Hungarian revolution, and they started bringing these twins from Hungary, then we were invited to New York, and I remember it so well, I was maybe seven or eight, we stood there with American flags and we greeted them. And it was especially exciting for me, because I was so young, for the first time I was in a hotel somewhere, We received a lot of response, we did interviews and so on. I think since we were the last one, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. And I know that we flew over Irimaa, and we had to fly over Irimaa, because there was something with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something else that was a problem. But then again they repaired it and I don't think we were there very long, maybe more than an hour or so, and then back to New York. So we don't have that ship history either. Then they immediately brought the buses to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Lona, New Jersey, and it's probably about three or four hours by bus from New York. There was a company called Seabrook Farms and Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large farm for over 30-40 years. It was one of the first deep cooling plants in America that was made with a deep cooling plant. And it needed work. And it needed work especially in the summer months, when it was the harvest season, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians arrived, the Japanese had arrived. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, Japanese people were also placed in burial cemeteries. The Japanese who lived in America, because there was a war in America, they started to bury here, or they started to bury here, maybe to connect with Japan, to do some kind of labor, or I don't know what they did. These were Japanese who had lived here for years, They had their homes, their houses, and it was more like boarding, not like in Russia. They were put in camps. They were told to take what they could carry with them, and they were in camps for a few years. And when the war ended, they were told to go and live, to look for their homes and places where they had already been. They were not allowed to go back there anymore, they were either liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them could go alone, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. So they also came to Sibruk, because Sibruk offered them work and living. In the middle of the 1950s, there were about 600 people, 600 Estonians. From my point of view, I have read somewhere that at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through here. Some people came here only for a couple of months and moved on. I was able to make contact with my relatives or to get a better job. But I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had such a good point of view. When people came here, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside, there was a toilet, there was a toilet, all sorts of things. There was a farm where they could buy food that they needed. There was a nursing school there. And my friends were there when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. And we were there in school like beggars. We were always there in the first classes. We had a tight Estonian life there. You are part of the Eesti Pyhapäevakool, which is held on Easter day. But there is also a church component, but also a little bit of practicing in Estonian, singing in Estonian, folk dance, a little bit of Estonian culture. And books from Estonia, packages to Estonia. It was a big part of my life to get packages to Estonia. I remember how many months we spent together, what we could do, what we needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money that we had grown up with, which was in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three grandchildren. Two of them were born in Sibruk. We always had a coffee-pack. I don't know what else was in there. We had planned for a long time what was in there. Finally, we made a pack and put some straw around it so that it would be solid and with an address on it. I don't know if we had to go to Philadelphia. I think I had to go somewhere far away to get it. Where could I get it? Should I get it in Europe or in Estonia? When I was five or six years old, I think my first books started to go back and forth. I remember that my great-great-grandfather, Herman Merikani Öde, who still lived in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. I didn't want to be an American, I wanted to be an American, because I didn't want to be like my grandfather, a relative of some sort, my grandfather was a police officer. And the books always ended up like this, in the beginning the book wasn't for my grandfather. You know, at some point you were able to name who you were really going to write to, because there was always this feeling that you didn't want to do bad things to people Someone who was a soldier in the German army, or in the police, or whatever. I am in contact with them now. I read these books, I understood them. My mother and my grandmother. What was going on there, what was going on here. It was a test. They reminded me of Estonian times. And what I always had in mind was that my grandmother and my mother always had different memories of things. It was like this today. No, it wasn't like this today, it was like this today. What do you know? You were so young, you couldn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know, things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was, oh, she was such a big fan of communists, Russians, red things. I didn't want to wear red. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was the cause of the red communists in Russia, that was for sure. But my mother was... Well, she was 16 when she left. And plus, she has this thing... I've heard so much that she had been deported. She was probably killed right away, pretty quickly. One father died when he was in Siberia. There were three children, one of them was a mother. The mother died on a train. At least my mother's story was that she was thrown out of the train window. She died as a child. When you grow up as a refugee, I remember my friends who are not Estonians. For example, Americans have grandparents, grandparents, fathers, grandfathers, they have relatives, they have children. You read children's stories, let's go to the children's story and see what old things are there. I haven't had any of these things. We haven't had any old things. We only had the things we had when we came. We haven't had any old memories in this country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our stories, our old things, The fire in Estonia was a house fire. It had never happened before, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship and you see that the wheels are broken. You are on this side and you see through it. And I immediately walked there, and everyone was standing in line, and I felt them all. I hadn't seen them in my life, but I had grown up with books. Like my grandmother and grandmother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, and I said, Lulea, Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti, and there were a lot of nice people with whom you have grown up a bit, but you haven't seen them in real life, but they are your own people.",
