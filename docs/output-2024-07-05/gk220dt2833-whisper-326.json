{"text": " So when I came home and didn't tell my family and then I went back to work in the morning and the guy who came, a robber, his family, I knew them all. They were staying in the back of the station. So his aunt came and asked me what happened. So I didn't know that she was his aunt. So I told him the story of what happened. So later I found out that that was his nephew. So then, I mean, he was caught and he got to jail and then he killed two other people over there and then he went to jail again. But for me, I didn't have any fear, sort of, you know. So that was it. So this next time I was, didn't happen. Didn't happen anything to me. I was doing something in my house, two-story building, and I went up the top where the gutter was. I'm doing something and I fell backward on the concrete. And all that happened was that I broke three ribs. I drove myself to the hospital and when I went, they laid me on gunnery and I couldn't move that time. So they had the x-ray and they found there was three ribs broken. That was it. Nothing else. And how far did you fall? About two stories. About three feet. About three feet. Twenty-five, thirty feet, I suppose. You know, I'm not sure, but two-story building was our house in San Jose. So that was my other escape. I could have broken my neck or some other back injury or whatever, nothing happened. So then, I mean, this cancer came. First time, that was also a coincidence that they found it so early, that I used to hike from my house to the bay. On the fourth of July, every year, the path was 22 miles. It's 10 miles from here to the bay and then two miles around the hills and Gorti Hills was all right. So it was around about 22 miles. And some of my club hikers used to meet me along the way. And I used to go there and come back. So that fourth of July, two years ago, I did the same with myself. It was too hot. So, I didn't eat enough food. enough drink so I lost some weight so I went to my touchy class and the lady teacher over there she said Ali have you lost some weight I said no I don't think so he said yes I do see that you lost some weight so after the class I went in the senior center I went on the scale and found that I lost five six pound so luckily next day I was going to the meet my see my doctor for some other reason and I'm just mentioned to him I said I lost some weight and he knew that I do a lot of exercise I was going to gym as well and doing hikes and all that so he could have said to me well you're do so much exercise to go back and eat enough food and you'll be okay and that's what happened actually that when I found out I've lost weight I ate regularly and so I was ago got again my weight again but he the doctor sent me straight away to see this can without asking any question so in a CT scan my right hand kidney was out of shape so it was not so clear so he said before MRI and there's they found that there was growth but very early it was only two centimeter so he said there's two options either I take my kidney out or stay there until it get out of hand sort of a or grew more then eventually they had to get take the kidney out because they can't do a biopsy on a kidney so I said told him I said just take the kidney out because I don't want to live with the body all the time so I went to the hospital in Hayward Kaiser so there they took my kidney out so I was okay then there was no post-treatment because it was found so early and I was fine I was doing say my normal exercise hikes and all that and then about three months ago the same cancer came back and got my clavicle joint under the chin so I saw a lump there so I thought I injured myself doing exercise so I went to the doctor and told him I said it's a lump there so I think I injured myself because I feel the pain as well in my clavicle joint so he said no I want a biopsy on it so he sent me for biopsy and there they found the same cancer kidney cancer so what happens that doctor told me that sometimes the cancer cells escape from growth and they float around the body and they get attached to a red cell a blood cell and they get stronger and settle anywhere so luckily it was still out there so they would see it and it was easy to for the treatment for radiation so they for radiation I went to radiation for 18 sessions so and it went to remission so then I'm okay again so thank God you know this I'm still leading my kind of normal life yeah five lives gone so maybe another two but by the time that I will be gone anyway yeah of course last thought is that thank God that what I went through I don't want wish anybody to go through in this way and also I'm so thankful that what you're doing it's a wonderful project and it should this what happened in that partition it should be told you know and people should learn lesson from it and not repeat that things again or anywhere you know in any country it's a religious war should not be happening because every religion is for peace but somehow the politician and the religious leader they don't think that way they are you see problem with this religion the they impose that they are the one who's the righteous one other way other people go to hell and that's concept which caused more trouble than reconciliation although a lot of things are coming in every religion you know but the people you know for me because of the leaders religious leaders another politician or whoever they are you know just the Leonard Hua n√≥s ouviutins leaders godly leaders politicians whoever they are you know just that's why I'm motivated when I consider the concept simplifying religion a must, beyond understanding indeed this man is a soul very invincible. way they do but you know for me I say that my own way of thinking is that just love everyone hate no one that's where I look at it and that's where I feel myself you know satisfied so that's all I want to say", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.32, "text": " So when I came home and didn't tell my family and then I
