{"text": " We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us... I don't know what it is exactly. It must be written somewhere. ...who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have photos and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. I think we were the last family. We had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letters that we would be sent to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. When we were the last family, there was the Hungarian Revolution, and they started to bring us from Hungary. We were invited to New York, and I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and greeted them. It was very exciting to me, because I was so young. For the first time, I was in a hotel somewhere. We didn't get a lot of answers, we did interviews and so on. I think that when we were the last ones, we were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then we got better and I think we were there for a very long time. and then he left for New York. We didn't have that ship's number either. So he took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey, and it's about three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was one factory called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large house and a cooling factory there for over 30-40 years. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. They made it right away with a deep cooling. And he needed a job. And he needed a job especially in the summer months, when there was the harvest season, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians came there, the Japanese had come there. And why did the Japanese... When America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, when there were riots in America, they began to fight here, or they began to fight, but more likely, to join Japan and do some kind of great work or I don't know what they were doing. They were Japanese who lived there for a year, they had their own homes, their own houses. And it was kind of a transportation too. Only they didn't know that it was a Russian transportation. Every year they were put in camps. They were told to take what they could carry with them and they were put in a few years' camp. At the end of the war, the children were looking for a place to live. Of course, the houses and the places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. They were either liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. They also came to Sibrok, because Sibrok provided them with work and life. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. I think, I have read somewhere, that at least a thousand Estonians moved through there. Some people came there, only a couple of months they moved on. Maybe they got in touch with their relatives or some better job. But we lived, I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, clothes, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy clothes they needed. There was a clothing store there. And my friends were Japanese and Estonians when I was growing up. We were always in the first classes of the school. We had a tough life in Estonia. You were in the school of Estonia Pühapäivä, which was held on Saturday. There is a literary component, but also in Estonian. There are some exercises, singing in Estonian, dancing, Estonian culture. Estonian books, bags in Estonia. It was a big part of my life, to get bags in Estonia. I remember how they gathered measurements, what to get, what was needed in Estonia. if it's possible to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money that we were raising ourselves, which was always in a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three brothers at the end. These two brothers were born in Zibruk. We started a coffee shop, for sure. I don't know what else went there. So, for a long time, we planned how to get in there Finally, the packing process took place, and a group of people gathered around it. It was like a group of people, and one of them... I don't know if they had to go to Philadelphia or... I think they had to go somewhere far away to get it. They had to get it from somewhere in Europe or Estonia. When I was five months old, I think the first books of 54-55 started to come back. I remember that my great-grandfather, Herman Merican, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. He wasn't American, he was American. Don't forget that he was my great-grandfather's relative, my great-grandfather, who was a police officer. And the letters always went around, so in the beginning this letter wasn't even for my old father. You know, somehow I was able to name who I was writing to. Because there was also the feeling that I didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. Someone who has been abused, and who may have been a German soldier or a policeman or whatever. That's how I'm in contact with them now. The letters were read and understood by my mother and grandmother all the time. What was happening there and what was happening here. That was the test. And they reminded me of Estonia all the time. And what always made me laugh was that my grandmother always had different memories. It was from that day. No, it wasn't from that day. It was from that day. What do you know? You were so young, I can't remember anything. I don't know very well, you know some things. The thing I grew up with... My mother was like, Oh, she was such a big communist, a Russian, a red-haired woman, and we were not red-haired. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was a red-haired communist, a red-haired woman, that was also for sure. But my mother was 16 when she left. Plus, I've heard so much about this story, that his parents were killed. His parents were killed pretty quickly. One uncle, Suri, was killed by a knife in Siberia. The other one, who was killed by a knife, he had three children. One of them was Imik. Imik killed Rongi. At least my mother told me They threw Rongi out of the window. He was born a child. When you grow up, your parents... I remember... Yes. Friends you grow up with, who aren't Estonians, Americans, they have old mothers, old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandchildren, they have grandparents, they have grandchildren. You read children's stories, let's go see what they have. I didn't have such things. We didn't have old things. We only had things that we had when we came here. We didn't have old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our burnings, our old things, you know, our relatives. There was a fire in Estonia, a house fire. There was never been a fire in one person's life, but it was a house fire. You get off the ship, And then you see that there are... I don't know if you've seen the wheel, the wheels, right? The wheels. And you're on this side, and you can see through it. There were a lot of wheels. And I quickly walked there, and everyone was standing on the side. And I felt them all. I've never seen them in my life, but I was raised with these letters. Like my mother and father. We used to walk with them all the time. I stood up and said, Luule, Liivi, Elmo, Kai, Mati, and it was like, don't recognize me, Robi.
