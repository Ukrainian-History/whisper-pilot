{"text": " A part of the film was turned off. The last family in the 50s in the 50s we came from Germany who was helping... I don't know what it is exactly, it must be written somewhere, who helped the Pögenik family. We were the last family who took them to America. I remember that because we have newspapers and articles about how my parents succeeded in getting them to America. I think we were the last family, we had to come earlier, my mother took my child and my brother and we had to come earlier. When we were the last family, the Hungarian revolution began and we were invited to New York. I remember it so well, I was seven or eight. We were standing there with American newspapers and we greeted them. It was very exciting for me because I was so young, we did interviews and so on. I think that because we were the last, we came to Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Ireland and we had to stop in Ireland because there was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. We had to go to New York. We didn't have the number of flights. We took Seabrook by bus. Seabrook is a small town in Luna, New Jersey. It's about three or four hours by bus from New York. Seabrook had a factory called Seabrook Farms. Seabrook was built over 30 or 40 years ago with a large house and a cooling factory. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. They did it with a deep cooling factory. It needed a lot of work. It needed a lot of work in the summer, before the Estonians came there, the Japanese came there. When America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps. The Japanese who lived in America, when there were riots in America, they started to join the Japanese and do some kind of big work. I don't know what they were doing. They were Japanese who lived there. They had their own homes and houses. It was like sending a message. They were sent to the concentration camps. They were sent to the concentration camps for a few years. When the war ended, the children were looking for a place to live. They couldn't go back there. They were liquidated or sold. They had to start a new life. They came to Seabrook, and in the middle of Seabrook there were 600 people. 600 Estonians. I've read somewhere that at least a thousand Estonians moved through Seabrook. Some people moved there for a couple of months. They got in touch with their relatives. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came to Seabrook, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, clothes, laundry, everything. They were given a place to live, where they could buy food. My friends were Japanese and Estonians. We were always in the front row of the school. We were always in the front row of the school. We had a tough life in Estonia. You went to an Estonian Sunday school, which was held on Saturdays. You had to learn the Estonian language. You had to sing in Estonian, you had to learn the culture. You had to learn the Estonian language. That was a big part of my life. I remember how they gathered the numbers. What could be done? What did you need to get from Estonia? Did you need to get a university degree? I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Seabrook. They opened a coffee shop. I don't know what they were doing there. They planned what to do there. Finally, the packing was done. There was a line around it. I don't know if you had to go to Philadelphia. You had to go somewhere far away. You had to pack in Europe or Estonia. When I was five months old, the first books started to come back. I remember that my old father, Herman Merican, who was still alive in Tartu, changed his name a little. He wasn't American, he was American. He was my great-grandfather's relative. He was a police officer. The books started to come back. At first, the book wasn't for my great-grandfather. You had to name the person you were writing to. You didn't want to make a fool of the people who live in Estonia. Someone who had been arrested, a German soldier, a policeman or whatever. That's how I got in touch with them. The books were read and understood by my mother and grandmother. What was happening there, what was happening there. They were trying to remember the time in Estonia. What always made me laugh was that my grandmother always had different memories. It wasn't like that back then, it was like that today. What do you know? You were so young, you didn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know things like that. The thing I grew up with, my mother was such a great communist, we didn't have a red flag, that was for sure. Everything that was world, what was the reason for the red communists, that was also for sure. My mother was 16 when she left. I've heard so much about her. She was killed pretty quickly. There were three children, one of them was a mother, and that mother was wearing a scarf. At least that's what my mother told me, that she threw the scarf out of the window. When you grow up, you have a family. Friends you grow up with who aren't Estonians, Americans, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have uncles, they have grandchildren, they have grandchildren. You read children's stories, let's go to the grandchildren and see what old things are there. I didn't have these things, we didn't have old things anywhere. We only had things that we had when we came. We didn't have old memories of this country. We didn't have these things, we didn't have any relatives. There was a fire in Estonia, one person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship, and you see that there are tracks behind the wheel, and you are here, and you see through it, and everyone stands in line. I felt them all around me. I haven't seen them in my life, but I grew up with these books, like my mother and father, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I was a reader. They were Liivi, Elmo, Kai, Mati, and they were people I didn't know, and some of them I haven't seen in my life, but they are your memories.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end":
