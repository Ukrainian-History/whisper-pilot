{"text": " We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us... I don't know what it is exactly. It must be written somewhere. ...who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. Andra was the one who helped us with Pögenik. We were the last family to be separated from Germany in 1952. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have photos and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. I think we were the last family. We had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letters that we would be sent to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. When we were the last family, there was the Hungarian Revolution, and they started to bring us from Hungary. We were invited to New York, and I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and greeted them. It was very exciting to me, because I was so young. For the first time, I was in a hotel somewhere. We didn't get a lot of answers, we did interviews and so on. I think that when we were the last ones, we were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then we got better and I think we were there for a very long time. and then he left for New York. We didn't have that ship number either. So he took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small town in Luna, New Jersey, and it's about three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was one factory called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large house in Seabrook for more than 30-40 years, and a cooling factory in Seabrook. It was one of America's first deep cooling factories, with a deep cooling of glass and wood. And he needed a job. And he needed a particularly long-term job in the summer months, when it was just the right time, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And why did the Japanese... Because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also put into concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, when there were riots in America, They started to live there, or they started to live there, but more or less, you know, to connect with Japan and do some kind of great work, or I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there for years, they had their own homes, their own houses, and it was like moving too, you don't know, it was like moving to Russia. Every year they were put into camps. They were told to take what they could carry with them. They were in the camp for a few years. When the war ended, the children were, you know, no longer looking for a life. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. Were they deported or sold? Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. They also came to Cibrok, because Cibrok provided them with work and life. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. I think I've read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and then moved on. You may have had contact with your relatives or some better job. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, food, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place to live, where they could buy food. I was a teacher there, and my friends were Japanese and Estonians when I was growing up. We were always in the first classes. We had a tough life in Estonia. You are a student at the Estonian University of the Holy Day, but you also have a written component in Estonian, some exercises, singing in Estonian, rafting, Estonian culture, and Estonian books, bags from Estonia. It was a big part of life, to get bags from Estonia. I remember how they gathered the measurements, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas money. Then, of course, the money that we had raised ourselves, which was always in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. We opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what else went there. It took a long time for me to plan how to get in there. And then finally the packing process and then some kind of route around it so that it would be secure and on the address. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia, or I think I had to go somewhere far away from where I could get it. From where I could get it in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five months old, I think the first letters of 1954-55 started to go back. I remember that my grandfather, my grandfather Hermann Merikan, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He was not a Merikan, he was a Merikandi. Because, don't forget that he was my grandfather's relative, my grandfather, who was a police officer. And the letters always went around in such a way that in the beginning this letter was not even for my old father. You know, somehow you can't name who you are writing to, right? Because there was also the feeling that you didn't want to hurt the people who live in Estonia. That someone who is an Arab, and who may have been a German soldier, or a policeman, or whatever. That's how I got in touch with them. The letters were read and understood by my mother and mother-in-law. What was happening there and what was happening here. That was the trial. They reminded me of Estonia all the time. What always made me laugh was that my mother-in-law always had different memories. It was like that. No, it wasn't like that. What do you know? You were so young, can you remember anything? No, I know very well, you know things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was, oh, she was such a great communist, a Russian, a redhead, and we were not red-skinned. That was for sure. And everything that was in the world that was a red-skinned communist, a red-skinned Russian, that was also for sure. But my mother, well, she was 16 when she left, Plus, I've heard so much about this story. He was kidnapped by his parents. His parents were killed very quickly. One of them was a big man, and his father-in-law was a Siberian soldier. The other one was kidnapped from his home. He had three children. One of them was a boy, and the boy was wearing a scarf. At least, my mother told me that he threw the scarf out of the window.

All our memories were in Estonia. Our memories, our memories, our old memories, our relatives. There was a house in Estonia. One person who had never been there, but it was a house. You get off the ship and you see that there is... I didn't know if I had a wheel on my back. You're on this side and you can see through it. I walked there and everyone was standing next to me. I felt like they were all walking. I had never seen them in my life, but I was raised with these books. Like my mother and father. We used to read them all the time. I stood up and said, Lule, Livia, Elmo, Kai, Mati, and it was like, don't recognize me, Robi.
