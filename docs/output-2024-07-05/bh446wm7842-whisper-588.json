{"text": " Jose Ehrenportuni Juan Luis güillo We were one of the last families to be released as from Germany. Andra, one of her assistants... I can't remember exactly. There's her signature somewhere... She was with a local girl. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have... ...newspapers and articles about how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. I think we were the last family, because we had to come early. We had already been informed in the letter that we would be sent to America. My grandmother came a year earlier, but my mother took care of the child. and my brother was born in November just before that. I think it was true. When we were the last family, there was the Hungarian Revolution, and Hungary began to bring them to power. We were invited to New York, and I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and greeted them. It was very exciting for me, because I was so young. For the first time, I was in a hotel somewhere. We didn't get a lot of answers, we did interviews and so on. I think that when we were the last ones, we were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then we got better and I think we were there for a very long time. or something like that, and then he went to New York. So we didn't have the same number of ships. Then he took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey, and it's probably three hours, four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a job there, which was called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large house and a cooling factory there for over 30-40 years. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. It was done with a deep cooling of grass and wood. And he needed a job. and they needed a lot of work in the summer months, when the weather was just right, when all the things were growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And why did the Japanese, when America was at war with Japan, then the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps? Because those Japanese who lived in America, When they arrived in America, they started to live in America, they started to associate with Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there, they had their own homes, their own houses. And it was a kind of transportation too, only they didn't know that it was a Russian transportation. Each of them was put in a camp. They said, take what you can carry with you, and they were in the camp for a few years. And when the war ended, the children, you know, no longer wanted to live. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. Were they deported or sold? Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. You also came to Sibrok, because Sibrok provided them with work and a living. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. You may have had contact with your relatives or some better job. But we lived there, and I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, clothes, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place to buy clothes. My friends were Japanese and Estonians when I was growing up. We were always in the first classes. We had a tough life in Estonia. You are a student at the Estonian University of the Holy Day, but you also have a written component in Estonian, some exercises, singing in Estonian, rafting, Estonian culture, and Estonian books, bags from Estonia. It was a big part of life, to get bags from Estonia. I remember how they gathered the measurements, What could I get? What did I need in Estonia? Is it possible to get some extra income? Then, of course, the income from which I grew up, which was always in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. They opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what else went there. It took a long time to plan how the mission was going to be done. And then finally the packing process and some sort of a route around it was done. It was going to be in Kindel and then Adres. I don't know if we had to go to Philadelphia or... I think we had to go somewhere far away where we could get it. Where we could get it in Europe or in Estonia. When I was five months old, I think the first letters of 1954-55 started to go back. I remember that my old father, my old father Hermann Merikan, who was still living in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He was not a Merikan, he was a Merikandi. Don't forget that he was my old father's relative, my old father, who was a police officer. And the letters always went around like this. In the beginning, that letter wasn't even for my old father. You know, somehow you can't name who you're really writing to. Because there was also the feeling that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. That someone who has been arrested and who may have been a German soldier or the police or something like that. It's like I'm in contact with them now. They read the letters, they understood. My mother and my mother-in-law all the time. What was going on there and what was going on here. That was the trial. And they remembered Estonian times all the time. And what always made me laugh was that my mother-in-law always had different memories. It was like that back then. No, it wasn't like that. It was like that today. What do you know? You were so young, I don't remember anything. No, I know very well. You know things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was like, oh, she was such a great communist, a Russian, a red-haired woman, and we were not red-haired. That was for sure. And everything that was in the world, what was a red-haired communist, a red-haired woman, that was also for sure. But my mother... She was 16 when she left. Plus, she has this thing... I've heard so much about it, that her parents were killed. Her parents were killed pretty quickly. One uncle was killed by a knife in Siberia. The other one, who was killed by a knife, had three children. One of them was Imik, and Imik was killed by a gun. and at least my mother's story was that she threw Rongi out of the window as a child. When you grow up in Baku, I remember the friends you grow up with, who are not Estonians, let's say Americans, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandfathers, they have relatives, they have grandchildren. You read children's stories, let's go up to the grandchildren and see and see what old things are there. I didn't have such things. We didn't have old things anywhere. We only had things that we had when we came. We didn't have old memories of this country. All of our things came from Estonia. Our memories, our burnings, our old things, our relatives. So, there was a fire in Estonia, a house fire. There was never been a fire in a person's life, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship, and you see that there are... I don't know if it was your wheel, but the wheels, right? And you're on this side, and you see through it, it was a straight line. And I immediately stepped on it, and everyone was standing on the side. And I threw them all away. I haven't seen you in my life, but I was raised with letters, Like my old mother, we used to take care of them all the time. I stood up and said, Lule. They were Liivi, Elmo, Kai, Mati. And they were people I didn't know. People you grew up with, but didn't see in real life. But they are your own people. Create. Share.
