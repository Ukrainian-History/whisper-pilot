{"text": " IS 000 GRANDORERS INUSE? It was our last family who left the German territory in the 52nd year Untra was always deputy... ...I don't know what that was exactly... ... twisting on residence keys. And we were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have photos and articles of how my parents were so lucky to have been sent to America. And I think we were the last family. Because we had to come earlier. It was already mentioned in the letter that we had to come to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that. And I think it was true. And when we were the last family, then slowly there was the Hungarian Revolution and Hungary began to bring them to power. Then we were invited to New York. And I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and we greeted them. And it was very exciting to me because so young. For the first time I was in a hotel somewhere. We talked very politely. We did interviews and so on. I remember when we were the last ones. We came to Flying Tiger Airlines. And I remember that we flew over Irima. And we had to stop in Irima. Because there was something wrong with the plane. I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then it got better again. I think we were there for a very long time. Maybe above or something. And then it flew to New York. So we didn't have the same number of flights. Then we took a bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey. And it's maybe three hours, four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a job there that was called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook was there for over 30-40 years. He built a big house there. And a cooling factory there. It was one of the first deep cooling factories in America. It was done with a deep cooling of grass and wood. And he needed a job. It was very difficult to get a job in the summer months, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, when there were wars in America, they began to fight there. They began to fight, but more likely, to join Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there for years. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was like sending. You don't know, it was like sending a Russian. Every year they were sent to the concentration camps. They said, take what you can carry with you. They were in the camp for a few years. And when the war ended, the children, you know, what they were looking for now, of course, their homes and the places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. They were deported or sold. Maybe some of them were left alone, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. There was also Cyprus, because Cyprus gave them work and life. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there, only for a couple of months they moved on. You may have had contact with any of my relatives or some better work somewhere. Where did we live? I lived there for two years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture there, there was food, there was laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy food they needed. When I was growing up, my friends were both Japanese and Estonians. We were always the first in the class. We were always the first in the class. We had a very tough life in Estonia. You were a student at the Estonian Holy Day School, which was held on Saturday, but you had a strict component, but the Estonian language, there was a bit of practice, singing in Estonian, rapha dance, Estonian culture. Estonian books, bags in Estonia, that was a big part of my life, to get a bag in Estonia. I remember how they gathered measurements, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas goods. When I was growing up, I was always in a good mood, especially when it was me and I had three brothers. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. They opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what they were doing there. They planned for a long time what to do there, and then finally the packing, and there was a line all over the place, that it was certain, and then you got the address. I don't know if you had to go to Philadelphia, or I think you had to go somewhere far where you could get it, where you could get it in Europe, or in Estonia. When I was five months old, even the first 54-55 books started to go back, I remember that my great-grandfather, my great-grandfather Herman Merikan, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He wasn't Merikan, he was Merikandi. Don't forget that he was my great-grandfather's relative, my great-grandfather, who was a police officer. And the books started to go back, so in the beginning, that book wasn't even for my great-grandfather. You know, somehow you got to name who you were writing to, because you also had the feeling that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. Someone who has been kidnapped, and who may have been a German soldier, or a policeman, or whatever, that this is now in contact with them. These books, they were read, they were understood, that my mother and great-grandmother knew what was going on there, and what was going on here, and that was the trial. And they reminded me of Estonia all the time. And what always made me laugh was that my mother and great-grandmother always had different memories. It was like that back then. No, it wasn't like that back then, it was like that back then. You know, you were so young, you could remember something. I don't know very well, and my mother was like, oh, she was such a big communist, Russian, red-haired woman, and we weren't red-haired either. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was red, communist, Russian, that was also for sure. But my mother was like, oh, she was 16 when she left. And plus, she has this thing, I've heard so much about it, that she has been kidnapped. One of her parents was killed very quickly. One of her parents was killed by a knife in Siberia. The other one, the one who was kidnapped, she had three children, one of them was a mother, and that mother was killed by a gun, and at least my mother told me that she threw the gun out of the window and killed the child. When you grow up, what do you remember? Yes, friends with whom you grow up, who are not Estonians, Americans, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandfathers, they have grandfathers, they have grandparents, you read children's stories, let's go to the grandparents and see what old things there are. I didn't have these things, we didn't have old things. We only had things that we had in Estonia, our memories, our burnings, our old things, our relatives. There was a fire in Estonia, a house fire, one person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You get off the ship and then you see that there is... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel, but you do, don't you? And you're here, I've been there, I've walked through all of Estonia, I was in a hurry, immediately I stepped there and everybody was standing there. I felt them all in my arms. I've only seen them in real life, but I grew up reading books, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I read, there was Livi, Elmo, Kai, Mati, Don't feel sorry for people who may not have been born or raised in the country, but they are your own children.", "segments": [{"id": 0,
