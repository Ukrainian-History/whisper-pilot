We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. My mother had a baby and my brother was born in November. My mother had a baby and my brother was born in November. My mother had a baby and my brother was born in November. We were the last family that came from Hungary. We were the last family that came from Hungary. When the Hungarian revolution started, we were invited to New York. I remember it so well. I was 7 or 8 years old. We were standing with American flags and we were greeting them. It was very exciting for me. It was the first time I was in a hotel. We were interviewed. I think we were the last one. We were invited to Flying Tiger Airlines. I know that we flew over Ireland. We had to fly over Ireland because there was something wrong with the propeller. But they fixed it again. I don't think we were there for too long. Maybe above or something. And then we flew over to New York. We didn't have a boat. We were taken to Seabrook by a bus. Seabrook is a small town in Lona, New Jersey. It takes about 3-4 hours by bus from New York. There was a company called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook. It was over 30-40 years old. He had built a big farmhouse and a cold factory there. It was the first deep cold factory in America. It was built with a deep cold of wood and wood. He needed a job. He needed a job especially in the summer months. It was the season when everything was growing. Before Estonians came to the country. There were Japanese in the country. There were Japanese in the country. And because America was at war with Japan, the Japanese also put them in death camps. The Japanese who lived in America. When there was a war in America. They started to die here. They started to die here more. Maybe, you know, to associate with Japan. They started to do some kind of labor work. Or I don't know what they did. They were Japanese who had lived here for years. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was mostly like boarding too. You don't know. It was like boarding in Russia. Anyway, they put them in camps. They were told to take what you can carry with you. They were in camps for a few years. And then when the war ended. Then the children. You know. Now live, search. Of course, their homes and places where they had already been. They can't go back there anymore. Whether they had been liquidated or sold. Maybe some of them got alone. But basically it was like that. They had to start a new life. So they also came to Seabrook. Because Seabrook forced them to work and live. In the mid-50s there were about 600 people there. 600 Estonians. In my opinion. I have read somewhere. That at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months. And moved on. Maybe they got contact with someone else. Or some better job. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good point of view there. When people came there. They were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside. There was a toilet. There was a toilet. All sorts of things. They were given a place where they could buy food. What they needed. There was a nursing home there. And my friends were there. When I was growing up. Japanese and Estonians. And we were there in school. Like beggars. We were always there in the first classes. We had a tight Estonian relationship. You were in Estonian Sunday school. Which was open on Saturdays. But there was a church component. But also a little bit of Estonian language. Practices. Singing in Estonian. National dance. A little bit of Estonian culture. And books from Estonia. Packages to Estonia. It was a big part of life. To get a package to Estonia. I remember how they collected a lot of them. And I remember that. They collected a lot of books. What to get. What was needed in Estonia. Does anyone know. Is it possible to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money. From which we had grown up. Which was not. Which was still such a good situation. Especially since it was me. And finally I had three grandchildren. Two of them were born in Sibruk. Always a coffee pack. Definitely. I don't know where they went. So. It took a long time to plan. How to put it in there. And then finally the packing. Making. And then some mess around it. So that it was solid. And then the address. And then one. Probably. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia. Or. I think I had to go somewhere far away. Where to get it. Where to get a package to Europe. Or to get a package to Estonia. When I was five or six years old. I think I had the first books. I started moving on. I remember that. My great-great-grandfather. My great-great-grandfather Herman Merikani. Who still lived in Tartu. Had changed his name a little. He had driven the Merikani. He was an American. Because we had to get rid of the fact. That my great-great-grandfather. Was a relative. Great-great-grandfather. Which was a border police officer. And. And the books always ended up in a way that in the beginning the book wasn't meant for my grandfather. You know, at some point you couldn't name who you were really writing to. Because there was always this feeling that you didn't want to hurt the people who lived in Estonia. That someone who had been deported and who was maybe in the German army or in the police or whatever. That this is now in contact with them. And they read them, they understood them. My mother and grandmother all the time. What was going on there and what was going on here. And that was the test. And they remembered Estonia all the time. And what I always had in mind was that my grandmother always had a different memory of things. It was like this today. No, it wasn't like this today. It was like this today. What do you know? You were so young, you couldn't remember anything. No, I don't know. No, I don't know. But I remember very well. You know, such things. The thing I grew up with. And my mother was, oh, she was such a big communist, Russian, red stuff fan. And we weren't allowed to be red. That was for sure. And everything that happened in the world that was the red communist Russian food, that was also for sure. But my mother was, oh, she was sixteen when she left. And plus she has this thing. I have heard a lot about it. He was taken away. He was killed right away, very quickly. One father died and his leg was cut off. There were three children. One of them was a mother. The mother died on a train. At least my mother's story was that she was thrown out of the train window. She died as a child. When you grow up as a refugee, I remember the friends you grow up with who are not Estonians, for example, Americans. They have grandmothers, grandfathers, they have dads, they have uncles, they have relatives, they have cousins. You read children's stories. Let's go up to that cousin and see what old things there are. I didn't have any of those things. We didn't have any old things. We only had the things we had. We didn't have any old memories of that country. All of our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our dreams, our old things, our relatives. The train in Estonia was a home train. It had never been in a person's life, but it was a home train. You come down from the ship and then you see that there is this... I don't know if it was a wheel, but wheels. Wheels. And you are here, and you see through it. It was like a wheel. And I immediately walked there, and everyone was standing in line. And I felt them all. I hadn't seen them in my life, but I had grown up with books, like my grandmother and grandmother. We used to read them all the time. I stood there and I said, Listen, Daddy Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti. And it was like, don't know these people to whom you have grown up a little bit, but you haven't seen them in your life.
