{"text": " We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. We were the last family that came from Germany in 1952. We were the last family that they brought to America. I remember it because we have pictures and articles of how my grandparents were so lucky to have brought them to America. I think we were the last family because we had to come earlier. There was already a letter that said that we had to come to America. My grandmother came a year earlier. My mother gave birth to a child and my brother was born in November just before that and I think the truth is that it was because of that. And since we were the last family, then later when there was the Hungarian revolution and they started bringing these twins from Hungary, then we were invited to New York and I remember it so well, I was maybe seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and we greeted them. And it was especially exciting for me because I was so young. I was in a hotel somewhere and we answered very nicely, did interviews and so on. I think since we were the last one, you know, we became Flying Tiger Airlines. And I know that we flew over Irimaa and we had to fly over Irimaa, because there was something with the plane, I don't know if it was a propeller or something was a problem. But then again they repaired it and I don't think we were there very long, maybe more than an hour or something, and then back to New York. So we don't have that ship history either. Then they immediately brought the buses to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Lona, New Jersey, and it's probably about three or four hours by bus from New York. There was a company called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook, who had been building a large farm for over 30-40 years. It was the first deep-drying factory in the United States. And they needed a job. And they needed a job especially in the summer months, when it was harvest time, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians came here, the Japanese had come here. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, they also put the Japanese in concentration camps. The Japanese who lived in the US, when there was a war in the US, they started to work here, or they started to work more with Japan, to do some kind of big jobs, or I don't know what they did. These were Japanese who had lived here for years, they had their own homes, their own houses. And it was more like a visit, not just a visit to Russia, you know. Anyway, they were put in warehouses. They were told to take what they could carry with them. They were in warehouses for a couple of years. And when the war ended, the children were told to go and live, to look for their homes and places where they had already been. They were not allowed to go back there anymore, I don't know if they were liquidated or sold, maybe some of them were, but the main thing was that they had to start a new life. So they also came to Sibruk, because Sibruk offered them work and living. In the middle of the 1950s, there were about 600 people, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1000 Estonians ever moved through here. Some people came here only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe they had contacts with other people or a better job. But I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good point of view. When people came here, they were immediately given a place to live. There was furniture inside, there was a toilet, there was a toilet, all sorts of things. There was a farm where they could buy food that they needed. There was a labor service there. And my friends were also there when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. And we were there in school like beggars. We were always there in the first classes. We had a tight Estonian life there. You are part of the Eesti Pyhapäevakool, which takes place on Saturdays. But there is also a church component, but also a little bit of practicing in Estonian, singing in Estonian, folk dance, a little bit of Estonian culture. And books from Estonia, packages to Estonia. It was a big part of my life to get packages to Estonia. I remember how many months we spent together, what we could do, what we needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some extra money. Then, of course, the money from which we had grown up ourselves, which was in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three grandchildren. Two of them were born in Sibruk. There was always a coffee-pack, I don't know what else was there. It took a long time to plan how to put it in there. Finally, the making of the coffee-pack, and a fence around it, so that it would be solid, with an address on it. I don't know if I had to go to Philadelphia, I think I had to go somewhere far away to get it. Where could I get it? Should I get it in Europe or in Estonia? When I was five or six years old, I think my first books started to go back and forth. I remember that my great-great-grandfather, Herman Merikani Öde, who still lived in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. I wasn't an American, I was an American, because I couldn't deny that my great-grandfather was a relative of mine, my great-grandfather was a police officer. And the books always ended up like this. In the beginning, the book wasn't meant for my great-grandfather. You know, at some point, you couldn't name anyone you could really write to, right? Because there was always this feeling that you didn't want to do bad to people to the people who live in Estonia. Someone who has been killed, who was in the German army, or in the police, or whatever. That's how I'm in contact with them now. I read these books, I understood them, my mother and grandmother, what was going on there, and the thinking here, and that was the test. And they reminded me of Estonian times, all the time. And what I always saw was that My grandmother always had a different memory of things. It was like this today. No, it wasn't like this today. What do you know? You were so young, you couldn't remember anything. No, I know very well, I know such things. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was, oh, she was such a big fan of the communists, of the Russians, of red things, and we didn't want to wear red. That was for sure. And everything in the world that was the fault of the red communists, the Russians, that was for sure. But my mother was, well, she was 16 when she left. And plus, she has this thing, I've heard so much about it, that she had been deported. She was probably killed right away, very quickly. One father died and the tree, where she was buried, fell down. There were three children, one of them was a mother, and she died in a car crash. At least my mother's story was that she was thrown out of a car crash when she was a child. When you grow up as an orphan, I remember the friends you grow up with who are not Estonians, for example, Americans. They have grandparents, grandparents, they have dads, they have aunts, they have relatives, they have children. You read children's stories, let's go to the children's story, let's see what old things are there. I didn't have any of those things, we didn't have any old things anywhere. We only had the things we had when we came. We didn't have any old memories in this country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our stories, our old things, our relatives. The fire in Estonia was a house fire. There had never been a fire in Estonia, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship, and then you see... It wasn't a wheel, but wheels. And you're here, and you see through it. It was like a whirlwind of wheels. I immediately walked there, and everyone was standing in line. I felt them all. I haven't seen them in my life, but I grew up with books, like my grandmother and grandmother, we used to read them all the time. I used to stand there and think. Livi, Elmo, Kai, Matti. And it was very nice to meet people with whom you have grown up a little, but have not seen life, but they are your own place.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.0, "text": "
