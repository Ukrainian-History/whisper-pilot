{"text": " The last family we had was in 1952. We came from Germany. Andra was a teacher. I don't know what exactly it is. It must be written somewhere. She was a teacher at Pögenik. And we were the last family. Andra was a teacher at Pögenik. Andra was a teacher at Pögenik. Andra was a teacher at Pögenik. Andra was a teacher at Pögenik. And the school took over. And we were the last family to send them to the Altered. And I think we were the last. And I think we were the last. We came early. The names of the children had already been honest. We were going to come up. Then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that. And I think it was true. And when we were the last family, then slowly there was the Hungarian Revolution and Hungary began to bring the refugees. Then we were invited to New York. And I remember it so well. I was seven or eight. We stood there with American flags and we greeted them. And it was very exciting to me because so young. The first time I was in a hotel somewhere we talked very politely, did interviews and so on. I think when we were the last, we came to Flying Tiger Airlines. And I know that we flew over Irima and we had to stay in Irima because there was something with the plane, I don't know if propeller or something was a problem. But then it was fixed again and I think we were there for a very long time. Maybe above or something. And then we flew to New York. So we didn't have the same number of flights. Then we took the bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small village in Luna, New Jersey. And it's maybe three hours, four hours by bus from New York. And after Seabrook, there was a project called Seabrook Farms. Charles F. Seabrook had been building a large house for more than 30-40 years. And a cooling factory there. It was one of America's first deep cooling factories. They did it with a deep cooling of grass and wood. And he needed a job. He needed a job in the summer months when everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And the Japanese, because when America was at war with Japan, the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps. Because the Japanese who lived in America, the Americans who were sent to America, they started to work there. They started to work with Japan and do some kind of big work. I don't know what they were doing. They were Japanese who lived there. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was like sending people. You didn't know that it was like sending people to Russia. Every year they were sent to the camp. They were asked to take what they could carry with them. They were in the camp for a few years. And when the war ended, the children, you know, they didn't know what to do with their lives. Of course, the houses and the places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. They were deported or sold. Maybe some of them were left alone. But the main thing was that they had to start a new life. They also came to Seabrook. Because Seabrook provided them with work and life. In the middle of the 50s, there were maybe 600 people. 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians moved through Seabrook. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. Maybe you got some contact with your relatives or some kind of better work. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live there. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, there was food, there was laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a place to live, where they could buy food, where they needed it. There was clothing there. And my friends were, when I was growing up, Japanese and Estonians. And we were there in school like beggars. We were always in the first classes. We had a tough life in Estonia. There was an Estonian Sunday school, which was held on Saturday. But there was a church component, but the Estonian language, a little bit of practice, singing in Estonian, dance, Estonian culture. Estonian books, bags from Estonia. It was a big part of my life, to get a bag from Estonia. I remember how they gathered measurements, what to get, what was needed in Estonia, if it was possible to get some overseas goods. Then, of course, the goods from which we had grown up ourselves, which were always in such a good condition, especially since it was me and I had three brothers at the end. Two of my brothers were born in Sibruk. They opened a coffee shop for sure. I don't know what else was going on there. So, for a long time they planned how to get in there, and then finally the making of the bag and then a line around it, so that it would be for sure, and then on the address, and then one, I don't know if they had to go to Philadelphia, but they had to go somewhere far from where they could get it, from where they could get it in Europe or from Estonia. When I was five months old, even the first books of 54-55, started to go back in time, I remember that my great-grandfather, my great-grandfather Herman Merican, who was still alive in Tartu, had changed his name a little. He was not American, he was American, and he didn't want to deny that he was my great-grandfather, a relative of mine, my great-grandfather who was a police officer. And the books started to go around, so that in the beginning, that book wasn't even for my great-grandfather. You know, somehow you can't name who you are actually writing to, because there was also the feeling that you didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia, that someone who has been arrested, and who may have been a German soldier, or a police officer, or whatever, that this is now in contact with them. These books were read, understood by my mother and great-grandmother all the time, what was going on there, and what was going on there, and that was the trial, and they came to mind all the time in Estonia. And what always made me laugh was that my great-grandmother always had a different way of remembering things. It was like that today. No, it wasn't like that, it was like that today. What do you know? You were so young then, you didn't remember anything. No, I know very well, you know things like that. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was, oh, she was such a great communist, Russian, red-skinned, there was a world, what was a red communist, Russian, red-skinned, that was also certain. But my mother, well, she was 16 when she left, and plus she has that thing, I have heard so much about it, that her great-grandmother was killed right away, quite quickly, by one uncle, a great-grandfather, a great-grandfather, and those who were sent out of the house, there were three children, one was a grandmother, and that grandmother fell on her lap, and at least my mother's story was that she was thrown out of her lap as a child. When you grow up, I remember that, yes, friends with whom you grow up, who are not Estonians, Americans, they have great-grandmothers, they have great-grandfathers, they have great-grandfathers, they have great-grandchildren, you read children's stories, let's go to the great-grandchildren, let's see what old things are there. I didn't have these things, we didn't have old things anywhere, we only had things that we had when we came, we didn't have old memories of that country. All our things were in Estonia, our memories, our great-grandchildren, our great-grandchildren, our relatives, and I remember that there was a fire, a house fire, for one person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You come down from the ship, and then you see that there is some kind of... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel, but you do, don't you? And you're here, and you see through it, there was some kind of barbed wire, and I immediately stepped there, and everyone was standing in line. And I felt all of them. I've only seen them in real life, but I grew up with these books, just like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I was a reader, there was Livi, Elmo, Kai, Mati, and I was like, don't touch that book. People who, who have grown up a little bit, but haven't seen them in real life, don't know who their son or mother is.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.0, "text": " The last
