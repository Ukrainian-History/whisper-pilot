{"text": " The last family we had was in 1952. We came from Germany. Andra was a nurse. I don't know what it is exactly. It must be written somewhere. She was a nurse at Pögenik. And we were the last family. We were the last family. We were the last family. We were the last family. We were the last family. We were the last family to be sent to America. I remember that because we have... ...newspapers and articles about how my parents were so lucky to be sent to America. I think we were the last family, so we had to come earlier. We had already been informed in the letter that we would be sent to America. My mother came a year earlier. But then my mother took the child and my brother was born in November just before that. And I think it was true that it was true. And when we were the last family, then slowly there was the Hungarian Revolution and Hungary began to bring the refugees, then we were invited to New York. And I remember it so well, I was seven or eight years old. We stood there with American flags and we greeted them. And it was very exciting to me, because so young. For the first time, I was in a hotel somewhere. We had a lot of interviews. I think we were the last ones. We were called Flying Tiger Airlines. I remember that we flew over Irima and we had to stop at Irima. There was something wrong with the plane. I don't know if it was a propeller or something. But then it was fixed again, and I think we were there for a very long time, maybe more or less, and then we went to New York. So we didn't have that ship story. Then we took the bus to Seabrook. Seabrook is a small town in Luna, New Jersey, and it might be three or four hours by bus from New York. And Seabrook, because there was a project called Seabrook Farms, Charles F. Seabrook, for more than 30-40 years, built a large house on top of it and a cooling factory there. It was one of America's first deep cooling factories, with a deep cooling of grass and wood. And he needed a job. At that time, it was especially difficult to get a job in the summer months, when the weather was just right, when everything was growing. Before the Estonians appeared there, the Japanese had come there. And why did the Japanese, when America was at war with Japan, then the Japanese were also sent to the concentration camps? Because those Japanese who lived in America, When they were in America, they started to get involved with Japan and do some kind of great work. I don't know what they thought. They were Japanese who lived there for a year. They had their own homes, their own houses. And it was a kind of transportation. You don't know how Russian transportation was. Each of them was put in a camp. They were told to take what they could carry with them. They were put in a camp for a few years. When the war ended, the children, you know, no longer wanted to live. Of course, the houses and the places where they had already been, they couldn't go back there anymore. They were deported or sold. Maybe some of them were left alone, but most of them had to start a new life. They also came to Cipro, because Cipro packed their jobs and livelihoods. In the middle of the 50s there were maybe 600 people, 600 Estonians. In my opinion, I have read somewhere that at least 1,000 Estonians ever moved through there. Some people came there only for a couple of months and moved on. You may have had contact with your relatives or some better job packing somewhere. But we lived there. I lived there for 12 years. I think that's why my father had a good place to live. When people came there, they were given a place to live. There was furniture, food, laundry, all sorts of things. They were given a boat where they could buy food. My friends were Japanese and Estonians when I was growing up. We were always in the first classes. We had a tough life in Estonia. You are part of the Eesti Pühapäivä school, which is held on Saturdays. But you have a literary component, but also Estonian, a little bit of practice, singing in Estonian, rafatanzu, Estonian culture. And Estonian books, bags in Estonia, it was a big part of life, to get a bag in Estonia. I remember how they gathered the measurements, what to get, What did you need in Estonia? Is it possible to get a foreign country? Then, of course, the countries that I grew up in. They were always in a good condition, especially since I was there. I had three brothers at the end of my life. Two brothers were born in Zibruk. They started a coffee shop, for sure. I don't know what else they went to. They planned for a long time. We had to figure out how to get in there. Finally, we had to make a package and put a list around it to get the address. I don't know if we had to go to Philadelphia or... I think we had to go somewhere far away where we could get the package from Europe or from Estonia. When I was five months old, I think the first books of 54-55 to go back in time. I remember that my great-grandfather, my great-grandfather Hermann Merikan, who was still living in Tartu, had changed his name a bit. He was not Merikan, he was Merikandi. Because he didn't want to forget that he was my great-grandfather's relative, my great-grandfather, who was a police officer. And the letters always went around, In the beginning, this letter wasn't even for my old father. You know, somehow I got to know who I was writing to. Because I had the feeling that I didn't want to hurt people who live in Estonia. Someone who has been kidnapped, who may have been a German soldier or a policeman or whatever. It's like I'm in contact with them now. These letters were read, understood. My mother and my mother-in-law kept asking me what was going on and what was going on here. That was the trial period. They kept reminding me of Estonia. What always made me laugh was that my mother and my mother-in-law had different memories. It was because of that. No, it wasn't because of that. It was because of that. What do you know? You were so young, you could remember something. I know very well, you know the things. The thing I grew up with, and my mother was like, oh, she was such a great communist, a Russian, a red-haired Asian, and we were not red-haired either. That was for sure. And everything that was in the world, what was the reason for the red communists, the Russians, that was also for sure. But my mother was like, oh, she was 16 when she left. And she has that thing, I've heard so much about it that it was taken away from him. It was probably killed right away, very quickly. One uncle, Suri, from Pugukust, Siberia. The other one, who was taken away from the house, he had three children. One was Imik, and Imik Suri was on the lapel, and at least my mother told me that she threw the lapel out of the window. It was taken away as a child. When you grow up, I remember the friends with whom you grow up who are not Estonians, let's say Americans, they have old mothers, they have old fathers, they have fathers, they have grandchildren, they have some relatives, they have grandchildren, you read children's stories, let's go up to the grandchildren, let's see what old things are there. I didn't have these things, we didn't have old things, we only had things that we had when we came. We didn't have old memories of this country. All our things were in Estonia. Our memories, our burnings, our old things, our relatives. There was a fire in Estonia, a house fire. One person who had never been there, but it was a house fire. You get off the ship, and then you see that there is this... I don't know if you've ever been on a wheel, but you are, right? and you're on this side, and you can see through there, there were some big rocks. And I immediately walked there, and everyone was standing next to it. And I felt them all around me. I had never seen you in my life, but I was raised with letters, like my old mother, we used to read them all the time. I stood there, I was a reader. There was Liivi, Elmo, Kai, Mati. And it was like, don't recognize the people you grew up with who you haven't seen in real life, but they are your own bodies.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.0, "text": "
