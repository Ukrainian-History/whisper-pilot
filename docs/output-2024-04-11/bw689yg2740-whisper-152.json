{"text": " The person who's going to say the blessing is Benny Shendo, who is the director of our American Indian program here at Stanford, and he's Hamas. I'm going to say the open prayer in my own language. So also, as I say the prayer, you can say it in your own prayer as well. So he would call us in my own town. I'm going to go down. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. go ahead and get started so everyone can be seated and find a seat. Okay, just to, we want to welcome you to Stanford University, everyone who's come from other universities. My name is Reyna Ramirez. I'm a part of SNAG, which is Stanford Native American Graduate Group, and we helped put this conference together or this forum together. We just want to say that this is supposed to be like a conversation. The way it's going to work is each person who's going to talk about their work is going to come and sit at this point in the table, mainly, because we are videotaping the event. And we'll present for about 10 minutes. And then the rest of the time will be for basically a conversation, just to talk about the issues that were brought up in the presentation, maybe some similar experiences we've had doing research. Just very informal. We want people to feel comfortable and just really enjoy the day. So we're going to start out with Benny Shendo, who's going to come up and say a few words. And then after Benny Shendo will be Jim Larimore, who's used to be the director of our American Indian Program Office, but now the acting dean of students here at the university. Again, I'd just like to welcome all of you to the second annual research forum. As Rania mentioned, I'm the assistant dean of students and also director of our American Indian program. I'm new to Stanford, I've been here for going on my seventh month but it's been really good. When Gil mentioned this forum last year, they had their first annual, really got me excited because it was one of the things that we really wanted to do is, you know, what are some of our students doing in terms of scholarship and work that affect Native communities. So we talked about it, and we began to brainstorm it. We did it last year, it was very informal. And it was a wonderful experience. We wanted to keep it that way. We wanted it to be a conversation, a discussion, so that we could really get a lot out of it. So we planned it, and both Renia and Gail have been very instrumental in making this happen again. So I'd just like to welcome all of you on behalf of our American Indian and Alaska Native program at Stanford. So I hope you enjoy your day. I guess this is kind of an unusual thing for me, because as Renia mentioned, I've been kind of changing my professional identities around Stanford for the last year or so. And I have made a series of shifts. And the shifts that have come have been after serving for nine years as the director for the American Indian program, making a break and starting full time as a doctoral student over in the School of Education and Higher Ed and Administration and Policy Analysis last fall. And after six months of being a student, taking a leave and stepping in as the acting dean of students here, and after my first week on the job, which is just this past week, I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to going back to being a student again in September And just getting much more in touch with classroom life, with research, and with a chance to really focus on thinking hard about things, on how things are, how they got that way, and maybe how they could be. And so this is, for me, a little bit of a homecoming in being back involved with the community after trying to maintain a little bit of distance to help my own transition this year. And so it's a real honor and a pleasure to be among all the folks that are here this morning. I spoke yesterday afternoon with Condoleezza Rice, our university provost. And it was then that she informed me that she had a scheduling conflict that had come up with a gathering up in San Francisco. And so Condoleezza asked me if I would extend a welcome on behalf of the university to folks that have traveled from other schools, other places here in California and elsewhere to be with us today. And so I hope that, and it looks from looking out behind the camera and out the window, that this may be the kind of Stanford weather and Northern California weather that we're accustomed to here. And so I hope that the surroundings will be pleasant and supportive of the kind of thinking and talking that you all want to try and do today. As Benny was doing his opening prayer for this gathering this morning, it reminded me of how important it is that as people gather that we pray and as we pray that we pray for wisdom among other things and that the wisdom that we seek is in order to make life better for those around us, to make life better for those among us and also to try and make life better for those yet to come. And I think that for me represents the spirit of what American Indian and Alaska Native research is about. We have been researchers and scholars for thousands of years, and it may not have been things that have been written down and recorded in the forms that universities are used to, but I think you can find no better example of scholarship and humane scholarship than the kind of knowledge that exists within our communities, the kind of knowledge that people are about working with and creating and passing on and so I want to say again on behalf of myself and for the university that this is an important gathering and that this marks I think a real turning point for the way that we can support each other and the way that we can support students and support faculty tenured and otherwise in the pursuits and the kinds of pressures that they face in their lives. As people go through the day, what I would like to suggest or offer as a way of thinking about this is that people realize that this is a time some of you may have met each other. You may have come with friends from other campuses. But this is a real opportunity to get to know people that you may come in contact with on an infrequent basis, people that you may not see until maybe during Palo season. You'll see folks around different places, faces that you might recognize in different parts of the country at different meetings or community gatherings. And so I hope that during the day you'll take the opportunity to get to know some folks that may not be from where you're from and get a chance to help establish a tighter community base for all of us that way. I would also like to suggest that maybe there are a few different ways to think about how this gathering is situated and what this represents, because I think it's important to be able to look at this assembly of people and to look back at how this connects with our past and to think about how this connects you with previous generations within your own tribe, within your own communities, within the campus communities that you're a part of, within the whole idea of knowledge and what that represents for our communities. And so as you're here and as you're hopefully going through some of the excitement about thinking about things that people are gonna present, you'll be able to feel some connection with those that have been here before you. I also hope that you'll feel a sense of that connection with the people that are here with you today, and that as you listen to people and engage in some discussions with each other, that you'll be able to do that in a friendly, cooperative, but even challenging way with each other, and to really help push each other to the best and the hardest thinking that you can do about things. And finally, which kind of brings me back to my old life, being, I think, more involved on a regular basis with the community here, I really hope that you'll carry some things away from this weekend that are going to help you within your own communities, and especially that are going to help you reach out to one more person, one more student, whether they're a very young kid, whether they're in elementary school or junior high or high school, or maybe a college student on your own campus. Because the ultimate measure of how successful we are is going to be how much we're able to do to bring more people along with us. And so the knowledge, the kind of energy that you pick up today I hope sustains you in your own activities, but I hope also helps you in your work as a community leader, as someone who has influence, as someone whose actions and thoughts and words carry a great deal of power. And so with that, I just wanna say thanks to all of you for making the trip here early on a Saturday morning. When I know that you've all been, no doubt, working hard on other things and we're getting up early this morning, may not have been kind of what your original intention been some time ago. We're just glad to have you here. And one final thing for, I guess I'll pass this along to Raina. As the day goes on, you may find that you're in need of a break or something a little bit different. And so given that this is research and I think sometimes people have fairly defined, rigid conceptions of research, I wanted to bring along a piece of poetry that was written by an Osage writer and poet named Dwayne Big Eagle, who has a poem entitled, My Grandfather was a Quantum Physicist, that some of you may be familiar with. And so if there's a break and you need something a little kind of interesting and scholarly in a different way, I hope that this might be of benefit to you as well. Anyway, that's it. That's as long-winded as I can get speaking for me in the provost. Anyway, welcome. I'm glad that you're all here. Thanks, Jim. What we wanted to do also is if the professors who brought students, if they could introduce their students, you know, their name and their field and all that kind of thing. So we're going to go ahead and get started. So I'm going to let the professor from James here do the introductions. Let me just stand up for a minute so I can see everybody. I'm very glad to be here again. This year, I'm kind of reflecting, as we begin this day, on what we did last year. And it occurs to me that we've doubled in several ways. We've doubled in terms of the number of schools that are represented here. I think last year it was just Stanford and UC Santa Cruz. And this year we've got people from Mills College. And UC Berkeley is here too, is that right? So we're up to four schools in this area. That's exciting. We've doubled in the size of the room. That's always encouraging. We wouldn't have had enough room if we'd been back in that old space. And I've noticed too that we've doubled in the amount that Gil Ramirez is eating so far. I had heard a lot of good things over the years about Jim Larimore, and it's been really nice to get a chance to meet him here this morning. And I feel like I've learned some things already. Although I'd heard what a wonderful person he was, I didn't realize how wise and knowledgeable he is, because he said everything that I wanted to say. So I know he must be wise enough. He said a lot of good things for us to keep in mind, and I don't have too much, nor should I really add to what he said. I do think this is an unusual event. I think that each one of us can think back in our own lives in whatever stage of the educational process that we may be in. And I mean the kind of restricted, institutional, formal kind of education that most of us in this room are involved in, in one way or another. There's other kinds of education, other kinds of knowledge that maybe aren't as widely recognized as such by a lot of people, as Jim has suggested. But certainly, we can all think about our experiences in the educational institutions and realize that an event like this is a pretty unusual occurrence, or we can just come together in what has appropriately been called a research forum for American Indians, or without having to defend the legitimacy of the kinds of concerns and questions and topics that we are concerned with before any kind of wider audience. So we can come together and talk to each other. That doesn't mean we all think alike. Doesn't mean that we all are going to approach any given issue in the same way. But that we can really come into this room and this space with a sense of community, of mutual understanding and respect and concern, and have a meaningful conversation. We can say some things, talk about our own specific projects, and also have a chance to learn from each other. I think one of the real ways in which the educational system fails us is when it creates a competitive environment that says that your worth is dependent on your GPA, or the comments that the teacher writes on your paper, or how you compare with other people. We know, I think, from a variety of different kinds of backgrounds that that kind of basis for human worth is not real solid. It actually contributes to a lot of the kinds of problems that we see in our society and in our own lives. So I would just kind of call that to our attention this morning, that we can kind of come to this with a different frame of mind, with a different understanding about what a human being is and what the importance of human creativity is. That doesn't mean that we can't challenge each other, that we can't push each other to think about issues in ways that we haven't looked at. I know I want to be challenged. I'm unfortunately not going to be here for the whole day. I'm going to Duluth, Minnesota, where I'm going to participate in the Tribal Colleges Consortium annual conference, something I've been looking forward to very well and for quite a long time. And I'm going to be giving a kind of a workshop, not really a, I'm not going to make a presentation so much as a workshop on some things that I've been working on in Santa Cruz. And mainly not because I think I have something to teach them, but because I want to hear what they have to say to me from the Tribal College context, you know, what we do at UC Santa Cruz. So I think all of us can benefit from those kinds of feedback and critique, but that there's a way in which we can do that that builds us up as a community, that builds us up as individuals, rather than in a sense of that, well, I have to show that I'm sharper than this person, or I've thought about this a little more than they have, or that there's any kind of a competitive atmosphere. We're all here for a reason. This forum's been facilitated and organized very well by Rania and Gil Ramirez. And we owe them a lot of thanks. And I hope at the end of the day that you'll, or throughout the day, that you'll have a chance to just express your appreciation for their work on this. But they've brought each of you here for a reason. And so there's nobody here that has to prove that they have a right to be here or that they have something to say. We're all kind of in this together, if you will. So I'm just going to stop there and maybe suggest a little bit about process. One of the ways we do have to sort of accommodate to the kinds of rules and regulations we've come to know on the institution has to do with the problem of time. And that is we've got a lot of people with a lot of good things to say here. And I know if we were maybe out at a community event or at an annual pow hour festival some type, maybe we could put our watches away, but for the purposes of getting everyone a chance to speak, we are going to have to monitor the time just a little bit. So I'm going to, at least for the morning, I'll be gone, in the afternoon you can handle it as you like, but for the morning I think I'll just sit up here and I'll probably prompt people when they get to about the ten minute mark with a slip of paper, and then give them about two more minutes just to wrap it up, and then we'll go from there into a time of question and answer and really be thinking about engaging and listening actively, not just listening passively, but what's really being said and what's significant about what's going on here and what might you be able to contribute. We'll also try to keep the questions to a fairly short format. If you want to make a speech, talk to Randy and she'll put you on the program. But if you just want to add another angle of thinking about something or ask a question, that would be the appropriate way and we'll try to get as many people involved in that dialogue as possible. In fact, I was also going to suggest if there's a couple people in the back tables who want to move up to these two seats in the front here, there's still a couple of open if you want to be part of this closer circle here. I just wanted to add that I asked Robert Warrior if he could help facilitate the question and answer. So if you want to say something, just kind of look at Robert and maybe just make a sign or something and then he can kind of help with that. Do you want to move up here? Anybody else that wants to just make a comment before we get going here or a response of any type to the opening comments? The other thing I wanted to do, just before we began, is which I Wanted to go around the room and make sure everyone just said their name, their tribe, and their school. So, I don't know. Let me start back here. Black, Glenn Lee, Ojibwe. Jim Laramore, still from Stanford Conventions. Lloyd Lee Dinette, from Stanford. Penny Woodward, from Stanford. Gil LaMarris, from Stanford. Karen Keefe, Navajo, Navajo. John Mamo from UC Boca. Benin, Shenmue, and Amish Boca. Jake DiMannico, Bailey, Sacklin Fox, Oklahoma, UC Santa Cruz. Lawrence Tobar, Comanche, Stanford. Terry Greaves, Kiowa, UCSC. And I'm James Treat, Creek, teacher at UC Santa Cruz. So we have Peter Son, DiMannico, Ken Omape from Stanford. Rainier Maris, Winnebago and Chippewa from Stafford. Melinda Meekow, Samuel Creek and Choctaw from Mills College. Chessy McCabe, Yavahos and Boise. Bramlett, Choctaw, Chippasaw, Cora, UC Berkeley. Theresa LaFargoise, Mallard. I'm Larry Gross. I'm from Minnesota Chippewa. Right now I'm in Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. I've come a long way for this symposium. Yeah, if at the end of the day you feel like it wasn't good, see Tina about getting your money back. She'll be glad to help you out, not on the flight, just the registration. Okay, well let's begin then. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Gil? I just wanted to say, for those people that are not from here, kind of some important things, the bathrooms are downstairs. Some ninja bathrooms right below here, and the women's bathrooms down the hall. Anyone else? Okay, we'll go ahead and get started then. It's my pleasure to introduce our first presenter from UC Santa Cruz, Terry Greaves' Kiowa. She's listed as history of consciousness, which is sort of a wishful thinking on somebody's part, not mine, but she's actually in American Studies. I wish I could convince her to stick around and be a grad student in Hiscon, so I could continue to work with her, but he's a graduating senior. And she's teaching a student-directed seminar this quarter, which is her last quarter, titled Engines, Redskins, Bucks and Squas, Images of Indians in American Popular Culture, which just started on Wednesday. She's only had one meeting. She's going to talk to us about her research, which she's been working on for a year or so that went into the course, and then talk about her course design and some of the things, the kinds of methodological and theoretical issues that that raises. And I think it's a topic that we all can relate to at some level. And hopefully, we'll provoke some good discussion that may actually feed into her course, too. So, Terri? Well, like he said, I'm teaching this class, and well, I guess I'm going to be a little more autobiographical than theoretical. But the reason why I started this, this class was going to be my thesis, and the reason why I started looking into images of Indians is because my mom owned an Indian arts and Craft Store on Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. And my entire life, all the money that we've survived off of has come from selling Indian things and has come from consumers' want of those Indian things and that identity. And I remember being a little girl and my mother always used to keep our hair in braids. And we used to play in front of the store and the white tourists would ask us for photographs and sometimes they'd give us money for it and sometimes they wouldn't. But we thought it was all fun and good and we'd get like five bucks out of the deal. And basically I guess they would come to the reservation on their way to Yellowstone Park to see Indians and they saw us, which was sort of funny because we're Kiowa and Comanche. We're not Shoshone or Arapo from the reservation, you know. So part of what my mother does is she sells herself along with the arts and crafts. She dresses sort of like the old ladies on the reservation dress, and she's always dressed like that from as long as I can remember, like before I was born. And that is one of the biggest selling points points to the things that she sells in her store. She's now in Santa Fe. And last summer when I was in Santa Fe visiting, I was hanging out in the store with her and she was standing there and my mother's like 60 now and she was standing there and this white woman came in and saw her and thought she was just the cutest thing in the world and ran right over to her and grabbed ahold of her braids and sort of yanked on him like and said, oh, you're so cute, you're so cute. And I remember looking at that and just being obviously appalled and wanting to hit this woman. But my mom, who deals with this on a daily basis, was very composed and said to her, please don't touch my hair. And I saw over this woman's face a sudden realization that she was dealing with a human being and not a doll, not this cute little Indian woman to be fondled or touched or bought or whatever. And I don't know. So that's what's led me to look into these, to look into what we're seen as and how we create ourselves the way that my mother has created herself because in a way she's brought this upon herself. I mean, she could dress like a white person and blend in and she doesn't, she sticks herself out and she does it for survival. And it's more than just survival of money, it's cultural survival also. And so let's see. So I've been working on this research for like almost two years now. And I've come up with this really huge bibliography. Part of it is annotated and part of it is unannotated. The last six pages are unannotated. And it's all information, books, periodicals, articles, films that I've come up with that all deal with this issue in one way or another. And I'd be happy to give this out. I'd really like this information to get out there. I hold no claim to it at all. The more people who look at it and think about it, the better. And the one thing that I found and the way that I structured my course was is there's two approaches to Indian images and Indian identity on the outside. And the first one comes from a white perspective which looks at the images as created by white people and imposed. And then there's, in the last, I'd say maybe, maybe even 10 years, not even that long, there's a whole bunch of Indian research and Indian writing and thinking that sees Indian identity as, that we have agency in creating our Indian identity the way that my mother dresses up and sells herself. And so, what was I going to say? Oh, one of the films that I'm looking at is by a Hopi filmmaker. His name is Victor Masiyesva. I'm probably totally slaughtering that name. But he did this film called Imagining Indians. And it's an excellent film. And it brings up issues for Native Americans, which There's not a lot, most of what I found doesn't bring up those issues for Native Americans. What he writes about or what he visually shows is Indians dealing with this thing of having responsibility for what we allow to be consumed, what we allow to be commodified. One of the things that he talks about is sacred items that are now for sale, or sacred items that have been turned into tourist items like pipe bags or something like that, and how we help that. We help in losing the sacred of our communities by doing that, by allowing things to be commodified. And it's something that I personally have a lot of interest in because I'm a beadworker. It's like I haven't had like a real job for the last, I don't know, five or six years and I've made most of my money in the last few years on beadwork. And what I create holds huge implications. What I decide to allow to be sold, the designs I decide to use. It can be extremely appropriative and a really sticky situation the more I think about it. He talks about, Victor Maciasva talks about this responsibility that we have as Indian people to our own identity and keeping the sacred sacred and using our good judgment, not letting money talk all the time. It's a really difficult lesson for me to learn because I'm poor and I really need the money. I don't know what else to say about this. I'm teaching this class and unfortunately most of the students in my class are white and I don't think that we're going to get into those issues that I would like to get into. And they're really issues that maybe only Indians can talk about because it's our identity that's at stake. And we're the ones that need to take control over the theorizing and the writing that's done on who we are and what our image is to the public. And I don't know. I think I'm going to stop there because I could go into greater detail about things like particulars that I found out about images but, you know, that might be boring. Thanks, Sherry. Are there questions people had right after that? You used two terms in your presentation, sacred and culture. How would you define those terms? Well, I can only answer personally. I don't know how else to answer, and I can only answer from experience. Identity is such a twisted thing in America, and it has to do with race, and for Indians it has to do with blood quantum. For me, my understanding is I've seen Indians that aren't really Indians, you know what I mean? Blood quantum, they're not recognized. It's the culture that ends up ultimately defining how they're received by their communities. In a way, I think that culture ... Do I sound like an anthropologist? I don't know. Maybe I do. I think that culture really defines a great deal of our identity, obviously. What was the other term? Sacred. Sacred. Now that's really sticky, that's like terribly sticky. Well the way that Victor was using it in this film was those things that are central to our identity. And those things that are central to our identity can be seen as culture. They can also be seen as a form of faith or religion. I don't like the word religion. It seems too institutional. I like the word faith better because it can come in any form. And I think that they're sacred for all people, not just Indians, obviously. And I don't know. I guess that's how I define it. I don't know if that answers your question. I have a question. When you're teaching in this group and the white students in there, are they, are you getting the sense from them that they're reinforcing those ideas about objectifying Indians as a commercial commodity? Are you trying to undo it? Do you see that coming from them? Are they wanting to take that and again go out and learn enough to again follow that path? I've only had one class meeting, so I can't tell you. I know, it's kind of an unfair question, but just thinking about it, because I always teach in classes that are primarily white students as opposed to these students. Yeah, well, you know, my hope is that I won't be reinforcing the stereotypes. And I think that the strategy that I'm going to use is to constantly refer back to myself, because I'm a living model, right, standing in front of them, breathing in front of them. And I have these stories, hopefully they won't get bored by them, but I have all these stories of what, how, I mean my mom's in the art business and the art business is all about identity, it's all about image. I mean image is the first thing that sells, the art comes later. And if I can in some way use my life as an example to show them maybe insights that they're not going to get by reading, you know, there's a really excellent book called The White Man's Indian, I'm sure you know it, Berkoffer, and you can't get that from Berkoffer, you know what I mean? It comes from a different perspective. So, I just hope by just physically being there is going to like push it, push the issue past those stereotypes. I don't know if it's going to work or not. I've heard all kinds of horror stories about how it doesn't work, so we'll see. You want to talk about how your course design addresses this issue as well in terms of the first half and the second half, the films you're using? Yeah, the first half of the course is all work written by non-Indians. And the film, I'm only showing one film, is Thunderheart. And they're all, they come from the white perspective. And some of them, it's just, some of it's really excellent work. And I really appreciate that. Some of it is very controversial. And I really appreciate that too. And hopefully, in the class, we can see how controversial and how almost polar opposite it is from the Indian-created writing and analysis, which is the second half of the course. And I'm using three films. They're all films by Indian people, Navajo Talking Pictures, Imagining Indians, and Herald of Orange. And I think, in particular, Imagining Indians and Herald of Orange are like two of, like they, when I watched Imagining Indians for the first time, I was like, yes, this is exactly what I want to try to get across in my course, this film. And if they can understand that film by the end of the class, I'll be really happy. I'll be really happy I'll have succeeded. And if you can answer my questions right now, in helping to deal with issues with identity, It just seems like we have a couple audiences, one mostly for Indians and one for non-Indians as well. And so I was wondering in class how you can, part of that would involve changing attitudes. I was wondering how you can do that, make that powerful, how you can preach it. I think you may have already answered my question. The class is a discussion class. It is not a lecture class. I cannot imagine myself lecturing. Like, that just seems really foreign to me. So, and the other thing that I have going for me is I'm a student. I'm totally equal level. I don't have an office. I don't have, you know, a super, like, professor's box at the steno pool or whatever. Well, actually that's not true. I do. But Anyway, it's like almost a level playing field that I'm coming from that professors don't have. And I hope that, I mean, when we're out in the real world, isn't that when we connect with another person, when we really connect, it's when we feel like we're on a level playing field, when we can really hear what they're saying. So I'm hoping that that's gonna come through. I don't know. We'll see. At the end of the quarter, when I'm not graduating, because my class is a total failure, we'll see. When my students hate my guts, I think I'm taking the hard line. I just wanted to ask you if you have any questions from your experience, if you might want to pose any questions here, since we have all the different people here in the room with the light. Well, I don't know. I guess my question would be, I keep coming back to this film by Victor Masayesva, which it's an incredible film and I recommend it to anyone, everyone. He shows the scene of these paintings on a rock wall, and he's talking about looking back through time how once we used to make these things for survival, for life, and then somewhere along the line, money started to be exchanged for these items, and then somewhere along the line. After that, we stop claiming responsibility for that whole process of exchange for survival. Maybe not seeing it or seeing it in the same light or not seeing it in the same light. I just wonder, like I said, it's a really difficult question for me to deal with my own responsibility to what I do, to the art that I do. But at the same instance, I do feel this responsibility to the sacred, whatever the heck that is, I don't know. I don't know, I guess my question is, what do people think about that? Of course, I think Indian people have always done that, but to a certain extent, I can see it in the movie industry better than in any other industry, is Indian film stars walking into roles that maybe are not the best roles to be walking into and doing it for money and then not liking to hear any criticism of them coming from the Indian community for doing that and saying, oh, well, the Indian community is poor and this is a way that I'm getting out of it. But in a way, it compromises our identity. Can I just add something to that based on some conversations that we've had in my office that she hasn't quite said it this way? But I think some of the things that I've learned from Terry in terms of the questions that she's asking that she's posing to the people in this room is that it's one thing for us to stand up and lament the commodification of Indian culture or the appropriations, the inappropriate appropriations committed in the name of New Age spirituality and on down the list. But what happens when we acknowledge that Indian people, both today and in the past, have been active participants? Not all Indian people, but there have been some. What do we do when we acknowledge Indian people have been participating in that? And the question is not a question of politics. It's not a question of laying blame, so much as it's an intellectual question, which is to ask what's going on culturally? What's the significance of that? It's not that by acknowledging that Indian people have been participating in it, that thereby, we can't blame non-Indians for what they're doing. It's an intellectual question, as I understand the way you're approaching it. She's really asking the question, what does this mean for us? What does this mean about Indian culture? What does it tell us? What kinds of questions does it ask? I haven't heard you say it quite that way today, but that's what I've picked up in our conversations as you worked on this research. I think it illustrates two represents a crisis intellectually, but also a level of responsibility. There's a moment, I think, I'm talking about the same Maciasian film of Rodney Grant from Dance with Wolves taking a comment, and that film is the same one, right? And where he, where Victor poses to him the question about commodifying himself, basically, what roles do you take, which ones do you not take? And he, and one of the questions is, well, are you going to take responsibility for creating Native American film industry for films by Native American directors like Victor. Would you would you take $5,000 to do a film with me instead of a million dollars to do a film over here? And Rodney Grant ends up sort of just sort of avoiding the question. He doesn't want to talk about it. And there's a way in which that the film problematizes for me an an avoidance of a real crisis. And why I think it's a really interesting topic to bring up is there's also not among Indian writers enough theorizing about this question of responsibility, because it's a really difficult issue. And teaching is actually one of those places where you have to confront it. And you'll find that out, and everyone here who has taught finds that out as well, where generally you you are in situations where you are somehow standing in as a representative of lots and lots of people and lots of points of view. No matter how much you don't want to be, that's the situation you're faced with as a teacher. And so you'll have to put it at that point. There's a wonderful side of that. There's also a really sticky part of it too. And I find that those people who really want to embrace that and say, yeah, I want to be that person. That's when you run into problems. If you're too eager to go into that situation Yeah, I'll represent the Indian voice to all of these people. So it's a huge issue that will probably come up all day. We'll move on to some other questions. Do we have this? Yes. You bring out many deep questions, many deep issues. I'm not sure that I understand everything, but there is one issue that you bring out and is really touching. it's the question of art and money. Because I'm a person who paint. And I use painting to know it before myself and also to try to come in with other person to share what I know or what I don't know with my art. And you just involve the question of sinning because we have to survive. I need to live with the art that I'm doing. And presently, I'm not ready to send my art because I don't know exactly why. And I'm not ready to paint to please the public when they want me, because the art for me is something more deep. And I understand a little bit you when you involve this question, but I don't have all the answers. But I'll just share your fear with this because in art, I think there is something very deep and it's really personal, but at the same time, I think that there is something universal in art. There is a kind of spirit inside art, and with money, there is something that I don't let us have. That's what I wanted to say. Yeah, my presentation last time, which I will try not to get into, basically dealt with this about Indian art, because Indian art is really defined in many different ways, and is defined by time. And antique Indian art is worth way more than Indian art presently made. But then within the presently made Indian art, certain types of art are considered crafts that anybody can do, beadwork, featherwork, woodwork, anything like that. And then there's another type of art that is considered fine art or high art. Pottery, modern paintings, baskets, like that. And there will be, like if you go into Santa Fe, there's like one whole gallery dedicated just to pots. And they're not old pots. They're pots that are currently made. And my question is, why isn't there a store dedicated also to beadwork? There is, but it's mass-produced beadwork. And I just, I question like what's going on there just within the market itself that defines what art is and there's something coming up on the thing about looking at Indian history and something about terms of Indian history and I think that part of that, yeah, not problematizing the term of traditional culture, because a lot of the modern artwork that's being made by Indians is traditionally based, but maybe not beaded tennis shoes or something like that with traditional designs on it. It's like, how do you define that? And how does the market define that? So we live in a market-driven economy, and Indian art is just like any other commodity, so we have to deal with that. Maybe with that, we'll let people comment during lunch and bring the bricks and things to Terry. I thought that was great, so thank you, Terry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For those of you who are following along the schedule and correlating it with the watch on your, on the end of your arm, we, we, the way we're gonna deal with the time, we start at about 15 minutes late, we're just gonna be about 15 minutes behind and we'll have lunch at about 12, 15, So you don't have to get nervous or antsy if we're still about 10 minutes behind on one. That's our plan for right now. Our next speaker is Jacob Manitole Bailey, Sack and Fox. And I wish Jacob were an American Studies major. He's taken a lot of courses in American Studies. But unfortunately, he was seduced by the Community Studies Board because they would allow him to do a six month field internship. And he's going to be going to Oklahoma to work with the Sac and Fox at the end of the spring quarter. Is that right? We'll be back until the first of the year. And he's been involved in a number of projects on campus. And one of the most important has to do with the repatriation process at UC Santa Cruz. He has been doing an internship and has learned a great deal about art collections, probably the second most knowledgeable person on the campus right now about the small collection that we have of Indian remains at UC Santa Cruz and has also taken it in his own characteristic, characteristically intellectual way and some very, raising some very broad questions about the relationship both institutional and intellectual between the discipline of anthropology and the American Indian community, and so has a number of interesting points to raise. He's going to talk about the whole repatriation situation at UCSC. Jacob? Well, I might get that far. I'm not sure yet. One of my nicknames for Terry is Boss. And I tell you that because I'm going to be following a lot of what she said in what I want to discuss today. And repatriation, as it has been defined, stands for, and this is a legal definition, the return of sacred objects, human remains, unassociated funerary goods, and items of cultural patrimony to American Indian nations. And repatriation currently is largely discussed within the terms and defined within the terms of NAGPRA, which is the Native American Graves Repatriation and Protection Act, which was passed in 1990. And I say I want to follow Terry because I want to talk about images, stereotypes, assumptions, responsibility, a lot of the same issues. And I also want to follow her by starting with a story about my mother, because when my mother was going to school, there was no such thing as Native American studies. There was no such thing as Indian education. If you wanted to have anything to do with Indians in the college setting, you went into anthropology. And a lot of Indians went into anthropology. And some of them made it. And a lot more didn't make it. And my mom was one of those. She dropped out of college. And I grew up with stories about the crazy things that anthropologists thought about Indians and the even sicker things that they did to our dead. And when I first started, and I'm really glad that there's a lot of anthropology students on this sheet. Maybe we can get a little dialogue going here, because I have a lot of problems. I've always grown up with a lot of assumptions and a lot of stereotypes about anthropologists. And when I first started researching repatriation, I uncovered horror story after horror story about past and current anthropological practice. And it reinforced a lot of the ideas I had about anthropology and what it does and what it has done to Indian people. And at the same time, I've had sort of a morbid fascination with the strange creatures and sort of the rituals that they seem to love to carry out. And those were the terms that I always thought about anthropology and anthropologists, when I started interning at the University of California Santa Cruz Archaeological Collection, the repatriation debate, and I shouldn't use the word debate. I shouldn't even use the word movement. I should use the word war, because that's the way that both a lot of natives and a lot of non-natives writing about repatriation, they've defined it as a war, as a war of science versus religion, a war of objective, cold, analytical anthropologists versus warm, spiritual Indians. And a lot of the titles of articles written by both natives and non-natives, A lot of prominent people are things like science or sacrilege, disputing the dead, preservation or burial, Native Americans versus American museums, a battle for artifacts. This is the mindset that prevails in a lot of places, and it was the mindset that I had when I started interning at the anthropology department. That was an extremely difficult process for me. You walk into this building. It's called Social Sciences One. I normally refer to it as the evil building. And it's this big concrete monolith. You walk up two stairs or four, the air starts to get stale. The posters that start to appear on the wall, Paleolithic culture and plains material items in the faunal area, people are talking in languages that I can't understand. And I get to the fourth floor where they keep the bodies, and I start getting pretty whacked out. When I first started my internship, I could only think of things in either or situations. It was either I go in there and I lay my agenda out on the table or I hide it and I compromise my sense of integrity. And every situation that I found myself in was a set of either or statements, neither of which I was happy with. And eventually what I was forced to do for my own sanity and to get anywhere in working to help the repatriation process was that I had to go out on a limb, I had to put myself out there, and I had to explain to my supervisor, who's an archaeologist, and my co-worker, who is an archaeology student, that I had a lot of fear and a lot of anger about what was going on and I was amazed, I was absolutely amazed at the emotional responses that I got from those people and what they told me about how they felt and how they had become sick, they felt forces and how hard it was for them to be involved in such a thing. And we really begin to build bridges to facilitate a way of thinking about repatriation that wasn't us versus them. It wasn't me carrying a banner going in there to get rid of anthropology and I think that Indians have a lot of stereotypes about anthropologists. Anthropologists have a lot of stereotypes about Indians and the dominant society has stereotypes about both of them which feed into a rhetoric which divides us and this one and this is when it comes to survival and when it comes to responsibility like Terry was talking about is that anthropologists the most of them when you when I've really sat down and talked with them the the basic thing that comes out is that they love Indians. That they love Indians, that they feel a responsibility towards Indians, that the whole reason they went into their field is because they wanted to help Indians. And they got into the field and then they found out that they had to do these certain things, which wasn't what they thought. And they ended up interacting with objects and with remains and not with live human beings. Repatriation has forced a lot of anthropologists and a lot of Indians to get over their fear about each other and to come together to work on projects to try to resolve this crisis, and anthropologists, and I use the term so generally and so broadly, and I refer to such a huge group of people, but there's a narrative that's emerging which is trying to succeed the one that's of us versus them which says we can work together and we can work together to do some important things. So that's the first sort of issue I want to pose. The second issue I want to pose is about how the rhetoric around repatriation talks about Indians and about how they feel about spirits and their ancestors and desecration and things like this in a way that really disturbs me and it disturbs me because it's not tribally specific and it's not guided by that. For instance, there's a national NAGPRA committee and they have field meetings which are helped to formulate policy and at one of these field meetings there was a presentation which represented the Indian viewpoint for that segment and the people who got up there were political activists and they basically said that all these bones need to go back in the ground and we don't care what they are. We don't care if they're Chinese, we don't care if Jewish. We don't care what tribe they are. The spirits have been disturbed. The spirits have been disturbed and we need to put them at peace. Repatriation was an inner tribal movement to deal with some very serious issues. Dangerous, dangerous issues, powerful issues. that I cannot possibly understand, and my solution is to look to the people in my community. I'm going for six months to intern with the Sac and Fox Repatriation Committee, which is made up of elders. Their response is that they need to move extremely slow. They need to be extremely careful because they're dealing with very powerful and dangerous issues and that they need to be guided by the traditional beliefs and the traditional ways that have guided them in everything else they do. What I see going on in a lot of other places is these remains, these ancestors, become a war trophy. We will get these bones back from you anthropologists. We will take them and put them in the ground where they belong. attitude I don't I don't know what to think about it because I don't know where it's coming from and I have a lot of a lot of documentation that I've been finally like finding lately for instance there was this case in there was this case in Kentucky at a place called Slag Farm and 1,200 shiny bodies were taken out of the ground by pot hunters. And Indian people immediately responded because of the desecration. But In addition to ceremonies to put, to rebury those people, a proposal for $157,000 to bring 700 elders of the International Elders Council came up, a local news story forecasted up to 100,000 Indians could be expected to show up for the reburial. The Evansville Convention and Visitors Bureau sent out housing forms to all tribal offices because they expected huge crowds to materialize. Members of the reburial committee started claiming that it would be the largest gathering of tribal hierarchy this century. A concert was proposed, a powwow, a sidewalk art show. Hollywood stars would arrive according to one of the organizers of the event. It became an event. And these are Indian people. Eventually the two of the organizers took off with $30,000 that they raised. And nowhere could I find that the Shawnee had had anything to do with this. So I think James has passed me a little note here, and I'll stop right there. That's great. Where questions people have? One minute. I'm sort of wondering about whether you actually believe it's wrong for groups who aren't directly affiliated with these remains to lobby for their reburial. And the example I think of is a few years back, a group of Indian tribes from southern New England reburied the remains of some Neantic Indians. There is no Neantic tribe extant today. And the Indians were buried on the Pequot reservation. The tribal medicine man of the Wampanoag Indians and the medicine man of the, I think It was the Passamaquoddy were presiding over the ceremony. And they reburied these remains in a very pan-tribal manner. They didn't necessarily do it in the authentic Niantic way, whatever that was. But they at least returned these things to the ground, which they knew was the tradition of the neantics to actually bury the remains, but had they not done that, these remains would have stayed in a museum or wherever they were forever, because there would have been no neantics to claim them back. The National Committee, they're basic, and this is of course rumored because I have not personally talk to the National Committee. But the grapevine says that the National Committee, which is made up of, I think, four Indians and three non-Indians, is saying that any Native American is closer to a human remain that's of Native American descent than any non-Indian is. And consequently, we will act on that prerogative. Now if there are remains which have no tribal affiliation, I don't know what to do about that. I don't have an answer for you. But what I'm saying is that a lot of people are saying, we're tired of waiting. We want to do this now. No more consultation. No more discussing it. We want those bones back in the ground. And my concern with that is that when I talk to tribal elders, they're saying, we need to take this very slow. We need to be very careful. We need to have a lot of discussion. We need, the Sac and Fox repatriation policy, I have it with me, says that we need the opinion of every single member of the tribe, and we need all of their knowledge, because no one can handle this alone. This needs to be a collective pursuit, a collective effort. So when a rash decision is made, and I'll use an example which strikes close to home, and I'll use it without names, but this university, Stanford, did a repatriation several years ago of Ohlone individuals, and it's unclear what type of consultation process happened, but there are Ohlone individuals today who will not talk to other Ohlone individuals because of the way that reburial was handled. Because the people who ended up receiving the remains to put them in the earth carried out ceremonies in a way that they found to be spiritual violence. And the words that they used was that it reminded them of when the Nazis buried Jews in mass graves. graves, and all they could do was go home and pray and purify themselves. Now I don't know if that individual speaks for the traditional Ohlone's. I don't know anything about it. All I know is that if someone had been more careful, had taken longer to engage in a process to make sure that there was unity in the tribe on how to move forward on this, then there wouldn't be that issue. And for me, it's so dangerous, and Indian people have waited so long to have this, that a few more years to work out some problems among you isn't going to hurt anything. To wait even three or four years until your tribe or your community or whatever has come to a consensus on how to handle the issue and has designated people specifically to handle these matters, then that's better than rushing it. It's not an issue that can be rushed. Do you think they can actually achieve that sort of unanimity? Well, I don't know about all tribes. The Sac and Fox, I think, are going to from the way it's going. The Hopi, for instance, they have four archeologists who work for them. They have an archeological program, and it's overseen by 18 clan elders and priests. Now I don't know how the Hopi feel about that, but it sounds like something that's better than, you know, giving up bones or sacred objects when there is still some doubt about who should be receiving those. This repatriation I have, and this is my personal opinion, repatriation is not an activist issue. This is not primarily a political issue. It's primarily a spiritual issue and a cultural issue. It's not something to carry banners around about. There is a proper way which needs to be directed by people who have knowledge. I don't know how to handle a repatriation. I would never go do that. Can I just chip in here? Because I think it's a really good question. And obviously, as you know, there are also a great number of remains which aren't even tribally identified, whether they still exist as a community or not. So this is going to be a continued problem. It seems to me that one way of answering this that's suggested by the work that Jacob has done is that I think what Jacob has done very well is he's developing a distinction between responsibility and ownership. And what he's trying to do is to show why those two things being very different have very different implications for how this is handled, whether it's on a tribal or an intertribal level. I think he's trying to suggest that if the bones are approached to something which is owned over which there can be a political battle, then it doesn't matter whether it's a tribe doing it or whether it's the National Congress of American Indians are going to run into inappropriate potentials, potential for inappropriate kinds of actions. If it's approached as a problem of responsibility rather than of ownership, then again, there can be appropriate solutions to either tribal or intertribal problems that come up in the repatriation process. I mean, personally, I don't have any problem with the propriety of these people, because I see that as an example of taking responsibility. Now, whether within their own rhetoric, they viewed it as a political battle, and they approached it as something they owned, I don't know. But I'm saying that it suggests a model of responsibility rather than of ownership. And it seems to me that's one really important thing I'm learning out of your work is how to understand those issues. And maybe I should be more specific. In terms of the law, one of the ways that institutions determine who they repatriate remains to is they look at the ICC map, which is the Indian Claims Commission map, which is a map that is only accurate for certain periods of time and has a lot to do with the political influence and the legal influence of the tribes who took cases before the Indian Claims Commission. For example, the Siouxs have a huge area on the map. And if that's the map that they're using, and they go ahead and repatriate to the Siouxs without doing any other further consultation, and it comes up later on that they have more documentation that says that those belong to another tribe or something like that, it can cause division within the community as well as a huge public relations problem for the institution. I have a couple comments. I was on the Patriot Community at Berkeley when I was a student there, and it was a war, because it was Indian and non-Indian on that committee, and we battled every meeting, and I have a box full of material that we produced, and had to read in addition to all of our classes. So it's not an easy solution. This division, not in my tribe in Oklahoma, but the Seminole tribe in Florida, they found some remains in Northern Florida by Tampa. And as Seminoles were most likely descendants of those remains, they contacted the tribe and asked them if they wanted to have that. So James Billy, the tribal chairman, went up there and said, yes, I want to take this land and turn it into trust land, because it's Argonne. And then he made it into the Bingo Parliament there, because the land was turned to trust land. Now, that's caused tremendous division in the nation down there, and the repercussions are still being felt. And some people said, how can he take an area that was sacred and remains? I mean, he didn't do it right on burial ground. But certainly, it's very difficult to take land and turn it into trust land. The government is very unwilling to do that at this point, and I haven't checked recently because I've been embroiled in a similar mission to Marvel Home right now, but what is happening, too, is that it's causing division for the people in there who have questions about that. So when I get the paper from down there, they're still asking. And James said, I always intended to do this. You just didn't understand that this was my idea in the beginning, because you have people saying, how could you set up a bingo? Yet another bingo parlor, even though it But it isn't a simple answer, and certainly the very fact that the Seminole Nation wasn't even formed until after contact has another ramification in it for those people, too, who are the most likely descendants. It is problematic. One more, and then we'll take a break. I just want to comment, I also, like I said, I'm new to Stanford, but I'm also one of the NAGPRA people that have been invited as part of their group to participate. We've only met a couple of times, and they talked about the Maloney Patriation, and I haven't really looked into more of that, but it's interesting that people felt that way, because, you know, I serve on that committee, and I'm the only Indian on there. There used to be two of us, but the woman's gone. But I can only speak for what I believe in. But I think I know about my tribe. And sometimes it's very difficult when you're asked. But I don't speak, I don't represent the Indian voice of all Indian tribes. But certainly, I try to do the best I can to talk about the sacredness and so forth. That's a big issue for me, because I come from a Pueblo that's very still traditional, and a whole lot of these things are sacred. And I've seen victory here. When you were reading that article about the Kentucky, it was interesting, because a couple of years ago, Hamas received a lot of the, there were no loans or anything, bodies, but a lot of, you know, Smithsonian repatriated a lot of sacred islands that had been taken. And the news people in Albuquerque were just, you know, really wanted, you know, to come in and document and film the whole thing. And it was just, it was just really crazy, but it was like the same thing as the Hopi. There was our priests and our clan leaders and those people that were involved in this whole thing. And the governors made an appearance at the airport, you know, just to do it quick, so the press would hear, blah, blah, blah. And we're going home. And that was it. We didn't allow anybody back on the reservation. And then once, you know, the items were brought to the reservation, they just brought them into the plaza, straight into the Kasichis' house, and that was it. There was no, we still don't know to this day what was there, but that's not for us to know because our leadership, our religious leaders, they did the appropriate thing when they brought these things on. And people, it was like, well, can you display these and we can take, when these people take a picture? And we just, I think it was very appropriately done. I don't know what those items are, But I don't question it, because I know the right thing was done from the leadership. And everybody's happy. And I think that's what's important. And I think we have a very reasonable confidence. I'd say we're off to a great start this morning. Let's thank Jacob, and then we'll take a break. So thank you again, and thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
