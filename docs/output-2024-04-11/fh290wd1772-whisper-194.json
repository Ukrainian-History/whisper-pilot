{"text": " I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the way, by Arthur Collins. Sam Jackson and his wife had led a quiet life, but Sam had been unruly here all day. So his wife said, Sam, look here, we've been married just a year, but the time has come when we must separate. You promised when you married me you always would be true, but all your married vows you broke. I've never, ever heard a truthful word from you, and I sincerely hope that you do. Then Sam, in vain, tried to explain what he answered with a sigh. Oh, well, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. I don't care what becomes of me, but I have this much to say. Yes, what I have to do I'll give to you, so I'll leave you here to paddle in your own canoe. Oh, well, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. Say, Virginia, the stand which you have so suddenly assumed is not in sympathy with the line that you read in my autographed album. What did I write? This. When the rocks and the reels they divide up, and you never more will I see. Just remember for your heartbroken baby who wrote these lines to thee. Did I write that? Uh-huh. Then you'd better forget it. Oh, well, I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. I don't care what becomes of me, but I have this much to say.
