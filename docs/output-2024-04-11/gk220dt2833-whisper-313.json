{"text": " So when I came home and didn't tell my family and then I went back to work in the morning and the guy who came, a robber, his family, I knew them all. They were staying in the back of the station. So his aunt came and asked me what happened. So I didn't know that she was his aunt. So I told him the story of what happened. So later I found out that that was his nephew. So then, I mean, he was caught and he got to jail and then he killed two other people over there and then he went to jail again. But for me, I didn't have any fear, sort of, you know. So that was it. So this next time I was, didn't happen. Didn't happen anything to me. I was doing something in my house, two-story building, and I went up the top where the gutter was. I'm doing something and I fell backward on the concrete. And all that happened was that I broke three ribs. I drove myself to the hospital and when I went, they laid me on gunnery and I couldn't move that time. So they had the x-ray and they found there was three ribs broken. That was it. Nothing else. And how far did you fall? About two stories. About three feet. About three feet. Twenty-five, thirty feet, I suppose. You know, I'm not sure, but two-story building was our house in San Jose. So that was my other escape. I could have broken my neck or some other back injury or whatever, nothing happened. So then, I mean, this cancer came. First time, that was also a coincidence that they found it so early that I used to hike from my house to the bay. Fourth of July every year, twenty-two miles. It's ten miles from here to the bay and then two miles around the hills, in Coyote Hills over there. So it was around about twenty-two miles. And some of my club hikers used to meet me along the way and go there and come back. So that Fourth of July, two years ago, I did the same. It was too hot. So I didn't eat enough food or not enough drink. So I didn't eat enough food. So I didn't eat enough food or not enough drink. So I lost some weight. So I went to my Tai Chi class and the teacher over there, she said, Ali, have you lost some weight? I said, no, I don't think so. He said, yes, I do see that you lost some weight. So after the class, I went in the senior center, I went on the scale and found that I lost five, six pounds. So luckily, next day I was going to see my doctor for some other reason. And I just mentioned to him, I said, I lost some weight. And he knew that I do a lot of exercise. I was going to gym as well and doing hikes and all that. So he could have said to me, well, you do so much exercise, go back and eat enough food and you'll be okay. And that's what happened actually, that when I found out I've lost weight, I ate regularly. So I gained my weight again. But he, the doctor, sent me straight away to CT scan without asking any questions. So in the CT scan. My right hand kidney was out of shape. So it was not so clear. So he sent me for MRI and that's, they found that there was growth there, but very early, it was only two centimeter. So he said, there's two options, either I take my kidney out or stay there until it get out of hand sort of way or grew more, then eventually they have to take the kidney out. So I took a biopsy on a kidney. So I told him, I said, just take the kidney out because I don't want to live with a worry all the time. So I went to the hospital in Hayward, Kaiser. So there they took my kidney out. So I was okay then there was no post-treatment because it was found so early. And I was fine. I was doing say my normal exercise, hikes and all that. And then about three months ago, the same cancer came back. And got my clavicle joint under the chin. So I saw a lump there. So I thought I injured myself doing exercise. So I went to the doctor and told him, I said, it's a lump there. So I think I injured myself because I feel a little pain as well in my clavicle joint. So he said, no, I want a biopsy on it. So he sent me for biopsy. And there they found the same cancer, kidney cancer. So what happens is that doctor told me that sometimes the cancer cells escape from growth and they float around the body and they get attached to a red cell, a blood cell, and they get stronger and settle anywhere. So luckily it was still out there. So they would see it and it was easy to, for the treatment, for radiation. So they sent me for radiation. I went to radiation for 18 sessions. So. And to remission. So then I'm okay again. So. So thank God, you know, that I'm still leading my kind of normal life. Five lives. Yeah, five lives gone. So maybe another two, but by the time then I will be gone anyway. No, we don't have that. Yeah, of course. Yeah. But that's me. Any other last thoughts you'd like to share? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Go ahead. Thank you. Have you any other last thoughts you'd like to add? Last thought is that, thank God that what I went through, I don't want to wish anybody to go through in this way. And also I'm so thankful that what you're doing, it's a wonderful project. And it should, this, what happened in that Partition it should be told. You know, and people should learn lesson from it and not repeat that things. things again or anywhere you know in any country it's a religious war should not be happening because every religion is for peace but somehow the politician and the religious leaders they don't think that way they are you see problem with this every religion they impose that they are the one who's the righteous one other other people go to hell and that's concept which cause more trouble than reconciliation although a lot of things are common in every religion you know but the people don't follow because of the leaders religious leaders and other politicians or whoever they are you know just that's way they do but you know for me I say that my own way of thinking is that just love everyone hate no one that's where I look at it and that's way I feel myself you know satisfied so that's all I want to say", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.32, "text": " So when I came home and didn't
