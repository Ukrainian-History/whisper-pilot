{"text": " My name is Elvira Prieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here. I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school. My name is Eva Silva, I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom. And I'm from Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado. I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano studies. I'm from a town in San Diego called Escondido, and um, what else, that's it for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna, I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education. And um, I'm from Burbank, California. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social studies high school teacher. You want to ask some questions here as to how this started and how it all started? How did this hunter strike start and why? How did it start? Speak to us as if we don't know. Okay. Well, I guess it was a buildup of a lot. a lot of different things that have been happening, not only on this campus, but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States, in the universities and everywhere else. So, you know, I guess I can run down, like, since my freshman year so many things have happened, the closing down of the Office of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the threats, with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers, and just these attacks on the theme houses, on the ethnic centers, and everything else, and then the laying off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean, everything just, like, piled on, piled on, and so many things were happening that we said, wait, we need to do something about it, and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening that we want to, that we want to do. I'm tired. I'm sorry. No, you sound good. Some people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this. Because the administration has been very, whenever we've had, like, meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever, we get together with any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with. And so it seemed to me, like, for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are outside, and just in terms of immigrant bashing and just the way that people in East Palo Alto are, that it was maybe the only way that they would, I don't know if it would touch their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it, or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it. Because otherwise, they weren't paying attention. It was just like, everything had to go business as usual, and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here, that it was from top down. It was what they said first, and then if we could deal with that, if we as students could deal with that, it would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Excuse me, what the university wanted, will then that was fine, and if we couldn't, that's too bad, because they're at their position, because, you know, they earned it or whatever. S? Yeah, because meaning after meaning, like, you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time, it was just, okay I'll give you a meeting from 6 a 7. S? I'll give you a meeting from 5 30 to 6 or whatever and... S? We've tried their methods. We've tried their methods of, working things out and their methods are to draw things out for as long as possible in order to not give us things at least you know they may say differently but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous to have to spend I'm sorry I'm slow but I'm a little bit tired it's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and you know they're trying to tire us out with just talking so that's what it had to come to and you know when people are not heard you know and this happens in society at large when people are not heard yeah you know I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors but behaviors that are not normal behaviors that are not normal are what happen and yeah this is not normal this is not normal behavior for us to be not eating but but but I really like to eat yeah we like to eat and you know it just I emphasize you know why are Chicanos in prison why are Chicanos you know in poverty that's not normal that's not normal for people but because of society that's how we are we've waited long enough for this I mean I know the administration is probably thinking well you know be patient and these changes will happen but we've been patient long enough and you know the Chicano studies major has been it was envisioned back in back in the 70s even the 60s and and we've been waiting since then and it's about time that that we get recognized you know Chicanos are are the biggest are are coming to be a majority in California and you know maybe even in the whole country after a while but I mean it's about time that our issues get recognized and that that other people just just really realize that we're not going to go away and if they don't educate themselves about us then it's just going to be worse for them Julia you co-authored a really beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres what for you is the significance of having the Chicanos taking the vanguard role in this movement which is really bigger than this campus for me I mean I don't know we didn't really realize it was for women until somebody pointed it out to us I don't I mean we knew it was girls but we didn't see it like you know oh you know there's no guys here you know like you know what's up with the guys but um I don't know I mean we have a lot of supporters that are male and maybe they didn't say they're going to go for the long run but they've been you know there the whole time yeah everybody like has has their roles and it's there are the negotiators there's people that are security over here there's like everybody has their roles and you know we're we're not the the most important because if it wasn't for them then you know nobody would be listening to us or whatever and there's other people that have been fasting also like Felipes he's been fasting these three days with us as well and like there's people that committed to three days and others that do one one day cycles to show their support and solidarity It's true, there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying, you know, like with the rest of the women also, trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this, and they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need or what needs to be done for the whole group, and so it's, I don't know, I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that, I don't know. Yeah, because I think, because everybody really does have their own role, and everybody's been really supportive, and we're working together, it's really actually, it just so, yeah, it just so happened that we're the ones that, that, you know, we're the ones that, that, you know, were ready mentally at this time to fast, and, you know, it just so happens that we're all women. Yeah, people are calling us guerrilleras, and. Revolucionarias, and all that, I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's fine, I think, that's what you're going to call us, but. That's nice, you know, it's really, that's really nice, but, you know. But, I mean, everybody, you know. Everybody's been revolutionary. And, you know, it's, it comes down to, like. The focus should be on everybody. Yeah, it comes down to, like, what your, you know, I don't want to say your talents, because we're, I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but. But pretty much, like, everybody has taken on the role that, that is best suited for themselves. There's Felipe. There's Felipe. You know, of all the things that you could have done, of all the actions you could have taken, why fasting? Why did you choose to fast? Well, it's obviously a really strong statement. You know, it's something that, it's uncompromising. And, it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people way before us, and, you know, have fought for. And, we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had, those, that vision they had is fulfilled. We can't just, you know, it may be 20 years, 20, 30, 20, 20 years later from the, you know, the Chicano movement that people think is dead, but it's not dead. We're here and we're living. And, we're the Chicano movement. And, Chicana movement. Yeah. Chicano, Chicana. Chicana movement. Felipe, you just joined us, but actually, you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning as, as was pointed out. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from, and, and your reflection on this struggle? Sure. My name is Felipe Barragan. I'm a freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California. Um, this struggle, I think, for me, it's something that's very important because, um, I went to high school in Watts, and a lot of people know what Watts is like, 1965, um, Watts Rebellion, the Ninety-Two Riots, there I saw issues that, that, that educational system for high school students and Chicanos, Latinos there wasn't addressing the real issues. Once I came here, I got a, I got a taste of it. I got a taste of Chicanos. I got a taste of Chicanos. And I found out how crucial that was. Um, and I think that, um, getting involved with the struggle is important for me to, to build the, uh, the processes with which we learn to deal with inner city, to wipe out the, um, marginalization of our people. You know, in terms of, um, your actions, you know, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study. And that you should be in the classroom. Not, you know, protesting. And, and so you're making a decision, you know, because it is, it is a pretty tough university to be at. And there's a lot of demands, and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance. How, you know, how did you make that decision? See, I guess, like, the main thing is, is, like, I never, like, when I, when I came here, I didn't want to come and just study and go to class and go back home, study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself. While there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools, there's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly, there's kids being born without hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just sit. I can't just sit. I can't just sit. I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on because, you know, that, that's, that's my people, that's my parents, that's my family, that's, you know, everybody. And I wouldn't be able to live with, with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done. You know, so, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it. Today we had, you know, little Chicanitas and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out and from Avala Folklorico group called Raíces de México. And they came out and they're, you know, they came out and supported us. You know, they're just little kids. I don't know. They're probably, like, from five to, like, twelve maybe. And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or study hours or whatever. You know, so that they, when they come out. When they come here, you know, they can focus, you know, on doing the things that they need to do instead of having to struggle so much. I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know. They struggle so that we don't have to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we don't. Struggle. We're still struggling, but at a different level. You know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry. Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about where am I going to get something to eat like before. Or how are we going to pay the bills? Remember, we're probably going to have to, you know, we're probably going to be able to pay even our parents' bills. Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, I think it also goes back to the question about where, why did we choose a hunger strike? It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA, you know, as we could have. And, I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable. We're capable of doing a work, but we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else because our issues are so important. And, I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that, but I don't know if anybody sees that. But, I mean, you know, I know that I could be a nice student, you know, but, you know, I choose, I choose to better be, like, to be a human being first and to care more about my people than about my grades. I was going to ask you, you know, related to the incident that happened on Sunday at the Flix, at the film, notaries, the show, how do you, how do you feel, or what steps can the university take to educate the student, the student community, even staff? Yeah. How do you feel about the issue of, you know, ongoing racism, the issue of why it's important to have abandoned graves on this campus? How do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community? I think if they really, truly believe that that isn't right, that the incident at Flix isn't right, or that people should know and should, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to the community, I think that's going to be a big issue. I think if they really, truly believe that what they're doing to people is wrong, then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university. If they really feel responsible for the education of their students, if they really, if they believe that that is an important issue, that people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students finding that amusing, there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level or something of the students at this university, and they are responsible because they're the administrators, they're in charge of this school. They're here to... They're here to serve the students, but they're also here to help educate them, and there's, I mean, to me, that proved just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me, but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful, and if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it. I mean, the main things that were, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about, you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time, and, you know, one of them being a campus ban on grapes, the development of a Chicano studies program, and the community center in East Palo Alto, and, you know, these are things that we can talk about specifically. And the offer for Cecilia Bulciaga. And the offer for a high-level position for Cecilia Bulciaga. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Cecilia Bulciaga, our high-level administrator here, Chicano administrator. Why is it important to the university to recognize Cecilia's contributions? Why is the CS position and Cecilia's role included among these other three? Well, basically, because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking that our education isn't addressing the real issues. you know, the issues being poverty, the joblessness, and, you know, the overrepresentation we have in the jails, and just everything, and she ties into that, because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues, she's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Grapes campaign, and I mean, and when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here, I mean, she's like a role model, oh man, I'm getting tired, yeah, what we're talking about, she's a role model, and a role mother, mother figure, mother figure, that's it, now, I guess, basically, because she helps in just keeping us here, because it's hard to survive in a campus like this, when you have people, like, Sunday nights at Flix saying beaners go home, or, you know, saying stuff like that here at Stanford, I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us, that you have to justify your existence, and you need people like Cecilia Bustiaga, and like Francis, that just help you out, just to make, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, especially the transition from, like, your first year, I mean, that's what helped me so much, living in Zapata my very first year, is, you know, I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think, because, I mean, she helped out a lot, like, with my parents, and just everything, I mean, I think, like, they're always caring for you. She's an important contact for us, I mean, there's so few of us here, and then there's so few of our, you know. There's so many Chicano and Chicana role models here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know, this happened to me today, or you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home, where I see a lot of people who look like myself. You know, and these are people that you can talk to, like Cecilia, you know, she's, she's, I mean, I find it incredible, she always has time to hear us out, always. Yeah. Yeah. When, when I was a freshman, like, I had a question. I had a question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a really nice story about her that when I, well, I didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year. And so, like, I had a lot of problems, like, just trying to adapt and trying to decide, like, what I was going to do with my life. And I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what I really wanted to do, which was to be a teacher. And my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me. And I remember going into her office and just, like, crying my guts out because I didn't know what, I didn't know where I fit into this university. And she had time, like, she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what I felt was right, you know, that to live my life. And I remember, like, I had a lot of questions about, like, what I was going to do with my life. And she said, like, two of these questions. And, like, I remember thinking, like, what do I do with my life? And she said, well, what do you mean by living your life differently than the other students? Because that year that, like, reading up peovalких only laid out my life. The thing was, like, this was my big smiling face. and I'm referring specifically to the various events that started at UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Colorado, University of Colorado, and Michigan State. Virginia too. Virginia too. Can you talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence of MECHA and Chicano student activism? I think as MECHA is the Chicano student movement, and there's a long history of activism there, leading back to the original plan at Plano Santa Barbara, and I think that each of us has maintained that goal of the betterment of La Raza. And our MECHA is very strong, and we support what those founding MECHistas came up with in terms of the Plano Santa Barbara. And it's gaining. It's growing. And several other organizations, and UCLA, and UC Santa Barbara, and other universities, MECHA members, and other organizations, are taking the leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands. The thing is playing instruments to roll. They got misquoted? They got a print tomorrow. Are they in support? Yeah. So what happened? They're going to print tomorrow. That sucks, man. Okay, so I'm going to wait. We're going to wait and see what happens. Good. Okay, so. Okay. I was going to ask you, I know earlier I talked to your dad and I talked to your mom and I know from them that it's been really hard for them, I mean they haven't been eating as well, they're also in a way also in the hunger strike, how do you feel about your parents' role in this, how are you going to explain it to your parents once it's over and you haven't really explained it to them, provide courage and that kind of thing? Well I told, my biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the fast was how my mom was going to take it, because I thought she was going to, you know, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick because any time she stresses out she has really bad attacks and stuff and I just knew I was going to worry. I was going to worry her and I was going to hurt her and that was the thing that scared me the most, but I talked to her about it and I kind of eased her into it, I started telling her first about the plan to stay out of the quarter and stuff like that and she was like, well, she told me, before I even mentioned to her that I was going to fast, she said, well Mija, when you are leading, when you are a leader and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad, sometimes you have to make sacrifices, she said, and you know, whatever happens, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support, and so then when I told her, she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was getting, you know, thought that I was going to get to that because I told her and she was like, well, she said, I'm not going to tell you to do it and I'm not going to tell you not to do it because I don't want to feel responsible for you doing it and I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe, you know, it didn't succeed or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want to do what you wanted to, she said, but I'm really scared, but she said that she had faith in God and as long as I had faith in God that everything was going to be okay, and so for me it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone, I decided to do it. I decided, this is, I really felt strongly about it already and I decided that this was something I was going to do and even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain, that I was going to get through it and that she was going to get through it and I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either and I haven't been able to speak with her since that last time I talked to her, but like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already past her youth and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore and she said, it's our turn. And so. Here we are, we're trying to make changes because I don't want to, I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this and I have a younger sister who's here also and I don't want her to have to, you know, continue this, I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here, but, you know, if I could, if I can help out in some way so that, you know, the kids that come here later don't have to be going through this, then that would be awesome, so, yeah. Okay. Okay. I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well, it's like, I knew, like, when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it, I wanted to be part of the hunger strike, I just knew that I could do it and I was going to have the willpower to go through with it, but the only thing was my mom, I didn't know, I didn't know how to tell her, I didn't know what to tell her, I was scared because I know that the way my mom is, she, she worries, and she doesn't sleep that night, and she can't eat, and it's just, it's bad, I hate it, I don't, I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything, but, I don't know, it's just something I felt so, so deep from my heart, I just thought, you know, so many people are going to gain a lot from this, so many people are going to, you know, have a lot of things come out of this, especially, like, with the East Palo Alto Community Center. And with the, the boycott on the graves, it's just immediate, like, help for, for people that are practically, that are dying and, you know, being born with birth defects. So when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it, she was telling me I'm anemic, that I was anemic, that my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count, and they were just coming up with all these things that I had, that I shouldn't be doing it because I was so skinny and I was going to disappear. And this and that. So then, oh, sorry. So then, after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard, she was crying and everything, and then I called her after the first day of the hunger strike, and she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone. So that, that was just made me, I was just crying, I was talking to my sister, and my sister was, you know, I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry. Tell her that I'm not hungry. Tell her that I'm feeling good, the issues are keeping me alive, and they're going to keep me alive, and I'm going to be okay. So, but she's going to come today because she's, she's worried, and she wants to see me. Well, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, to tell my mom and dad, you know, that I was going to do this, because like we've all said, you know, we don't want to make them suffer. But I told her and she said, you know, okay, we're going to do this. And I said, you know, okay, well, if you guys are still out there after three days, then I'm going to come out. And then right, like, a few minutes before I left I was talking to her, and . Do I have to translate that? Oh, okay. And then, and then, so, you know, she was, she was crying, and I could tell, and she was giving me the . And so she was like, you know what, I'm going to be out there tomorrow, and stuff. And, you know, my mom and dad got some money together. And then. So my mom could fly out here and stuff and so she came out last night and I mean I think it was better for her to come because she was upset when she saw me and she was crying and stuff but you know she's been really good and everybody's been really supportive of her and she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful to this thing. She feels a part of this strike and you know she feels a part of the movement and you know I think that she is because I'm fighting for her and for everybody and you know she slept out there with us last night so she's hardcore. For me that was definitely the hardest part and after I did it I wish that I didn't have to but I know that if I hadn't it would have been worse for her if she had found out some other way. So yeah. Yeah. I'm just really worried about her because she has heart problems and I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something that you know we'd send out everything but you know she's fine and she already told me that she supports me and even though it's the hardest thing you know for her like she knows. I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight and maybe that hopefully that made her feel a little bit better but maybe hopefully I don't know I don't know exactly how she is. Our last time I talked to her she sounded very weak and my dad called me like the next morning the morning after I told my mom and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it. He told me all kinds of things and he told me why do you want to why do you want to go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers in your life and just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through. Just to get where I am and trying to tell me well don't you know don't do it but I still did it and he's here right now and he came and told me he's still trying to convince me to stop because he goes he says if you know your mom's going to come up here tomorrow and if you're still on the strike she's going to strike with you so I don't know. I think generally my parents have the same feelings as all the others do but it's a little bit easier for them to handle. Because tonight's going to be my last day of fasting so that's basically it. Last word? Well okay you said it's for historical purposes right? So when you know 20 years from now when other Chicanos look at this you know we. And Chicanas. And Chicanas. Sorry I'm tired. You know when other gentes see this just to remember that you know we're all going through this. And you know even when you're looking at this now 20 years later the movement is still alive in you and we still have to keep struggling because you know. Well hopefully we can stop. Hopefully we can stop some of it but I mean if it's still if it's still bad you know for 20 years from now you know we can do it you know. And don't take advantage of what you know what you have I guess like like for us it's very important to to say oh we have we have el centro and there's a lot of people that worked hard for it. Don't don't. Don't settle for what you don't settle for what you have and don't forget us pretty much don't forget the people who fought before you all the things like the people that fought before us and before us and before them and just remember we're you know we're doing this for you for for the future. For the new. For the new. It is currently about 730 on the 6th of May Friday. It is currently about 730 on the 6th of May Friday. Nineteen ninety four we have just collected. Witness the five testimonials from from five of the of the hunger strikers which have included at one point over one hundred solidarity strikers at this time we've received the latest response from the administration which has been recalcitrant up to this point and I understand that there's still many points that need to be. Need to be reviewed and some more dialogue that needs to be that needs to take place but at the moment it looks as though a statement that that we have made as a community that you got a community and a statement that comes from various communities throughout the Bay Area and the nation and solidarity with us has open or begun to open the administration's eyes to the justness of our cause and our demands. However. Hair. Hair. creature there are other eye. There is some work to be done. It seems as though our first demand that is the the offering of a high level position to associate Dean Cего was still not being met. And. And. And. As I said, this is our first demand and it's very important to us. So more negotiation has to. So more negotiation has to. Dymo on with regards to that the second demand involves. establishment of a community center in East Palo Alto to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university. And as far as the university's administration is concerned, they are receptive to the initiative that the Chicano students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy. This has been a very important component to the struggle here. As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new. It goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara, which inaugurated METCHA. So we are very hopeful that some breakthrough will come through here. As regards to the Chicano and Chicana Studies, again, this is the justness and the feasibility of this. This demand has led the administration to also give overtures that are encouraging. Finally, the issue of grapes on campus, and specifically the negative reactions, the racist reactions to our efforts to educate the community at Stanford, and our protests against those negative reactions, has led the university to embark upon a new initiative. To educate all the dorms, through the showing of the No Grapes video, and also through establishing a dialogue with our community, the Chicano community, in an effort to bridge the gaps that have been caused, bridge the divisions that have been caused by the racism that's very often a result of an academy. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Sasha. Thank you to each and every one of you who came out here and spoke out for me. Thank you, receives and呢 one more time for sharing some of the evidence. But the truth is, next slide, would assess, I spent, in my school at Chicago that those ornaments that I built. I can show you them in my Clemson webinar. But it's fromina when Billy Magdalene showed up, and I wanted her to explain. And then one of my colleagues, Jamie Patch Gr Block, little partner with me, said to me, hey, Joe, what do do you think about getting to the� our name on the board of interpreters today? And I thought, why would we go here? I thought, you know, a coach on campus. It's the right thing. Thank you.
