{"text": " The United States Constitution does not mention sexual freedom, but the United States Supreme Court, whose main job is to interpret the Constitution, has found that the Constitution does provide the right to privacy and self-determination. The Court has not defined this right very clearly, but it does recognize the right to, for instance, an abortion within limits, and the right to use and receive information about contraceptives. According to the Supreme Court, the basis for this right comes from the protections of the Bill of Rights. For instance, the First Amendment's freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of association. The Third Amendment's protection of each citizen's home from the quartering of soldiers in peacetime. The Fourth Amendment's protection of each citizen's person and home against unreasonable search and seizure. The Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. And the Ninth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. The Ninth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination. And the Ninth Amendment's protection from governmental infringement of certain unspecified rights of the people. It's both fortunate and unfortunate that those rights have not been specified. Besides finding this right to privacy, the Supreme Court has indicated that groups considered to be what they call discrete and insular minorities, such as racial and ethnic groups, need special protection under the Constitution, particularly to ensure that they have a right to privacy. They have equal access to this nation's political and governmental processes. So, with all these protections, why hasn't the Supreme Court upheld the rights of gays and lesbians to live and work without discrimination? The answer is not because of any lack of cases. The Court ducked a number of gay rights issues in the 1970s and wiggled out of one Virginia case in 1976 by affirming a lower court decision without hearing any arguments or giving any reasons. In short, the Supreme Court has hoped the issue of gay rights would go away. Why? Well, because with all of these other holdings setting the trend, the Court would appear extremely inconsistent if it decided against gay rights. And yet, if it decided in favor of gay rights, despite negative public opinion, the Court might undermine its authority and jeopardize its ability to enforce unpopular rulings. After all, the United States Supreme Court has no army. It has no army to back up its decisions, nor does it have control of federal funds with which to coerce compliance. Another possible reason for the Court's reluctance to handle gay rights cases is that the Court's two liberal members, Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, fear they would be outvoted on the issue. And they've been delaying gay rights cases because they fear a bad decision would be worse than no decision. If Brennan and Marshall are stalling for a time when the Court will be more liberal, it is doubtful they will be outvoted. They will live long enough. Brennan is 77, Marshall is 75 and in poor health. And if Reagan is re-elected, we probably will have an extremely conservative Supreme Court for the rest of this century. So, tonight we have asked Leonard Graff, the legal director of National Gay Rights Advocates, to tell us what cases are pending in the nation's courts, including the Supreme Court this year, and what the chances are that 1984 will be a major year in the history of gay rights, for better or for worse. National Gay Rights Advocates, which is based in San Francisco, is a private, non-profit law firm that acts as a clearinghouse for a large number of gay rights cases throughout the nation. It is similar to the American Civil Liberties Union in that it fines lawyers nationwide who are willing to donate their time to specific cases. As legal director for the past year and a half, Leonard Graff coordinates those legal efforts. They're all yours. Thank you very much. I'm pleased to be here tonight to talk to you about the current gay rights litigation that's going on around the country. And what I'd like to do is sort of break it down by different categories. And rather than lecture, I just assume make it more of a discussion. So, if you have questions as I'm going along, feel free to raise your hands and interrupt. I understand that a good number of you are not law students. And so, I'll try. I'll try to keep my terms as general and in the lay language as possible. If you don't understand something I'm talking about, please let me know and I'll try to explain it the best I can. I'd like to start out first talking about an area which is very important to gay rights advocates. It's an issue we've been working on for about five years, and that's the immigration naturalization issue. And what I'll probably do is conclude with an issue which I think many of you will find important, which is the rights of gay students in this country. And by no means is this issue settled at all. In the area of immigration naturalization, we won at Gay Rights Advocates a very important victory in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in the case of Carl Hill versus INS. And the Immigration Nationality Act prohibits homosexuals from entering the country. However, you don't find the word homosexual anywhere in the immigration nationality. What you find is a Supreme Court decision which has interpreted the language of the act to exclude homosexuals. And the precise terminology that they interpreted was psychopathic personality. Since gay people are afflicted with a psychopathic personality, they must be excluded from the country. Now the question is, which we raised in the Carl Hill case, is how do you determine who is a homosexual? It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. It is our position at Gay Rights Advocates to determine who is a homosexual. The only way to make this determination under the law is through an examination by a public health service doctor. That doctor must examine the arriving alien and say to that alien, to our gay issue of what is known as a Plac√© certificate, and then the INS can exclude the person from the country. Now the government's position is that a person is able to decide for themselves whether or not they're gay. And if they say they're gay, they are gay, and can be excluded from the country. This is the issue. The U.S. District Court here in the Northern District of California agreed with Gay Rights Advocates that a doctor's certificate from the public health service must issue. The case involved Carl Hill, who's a tourist, who's here for pleasure, and a journalist, a photographer for a London newspaper. Now the same issue arose again in the case of Richard Longstaff, which is a case that we have just filed. He filed a petition for review in the United States Supreme Court, a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision. The Fifth Circuit sits in New Orleans. Mr. Longstaff is a resident of Dallas, Texas. He's been here about 20 years now. He came here on a valid immigrant visa. He subsequently opened up two boutiques, clothing stores, and hairdressing salons. He employs about 20 citizens of this country. He pays over $100,000 a year. And our government has said to Richard Longstaff, you're not good enough to be an American citizen. Why has our government said that? Because Richard Longstaff is gay. And that is the position that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld. So what we have now is a clear conflict between two circuits. I might have skipped over this, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals here has affirmed the decision of Carl Hill. What we did is file a petition in the Supreme Court, asking them to review the Fifth Circuit decision and to resolve the conflict between the two different courts of appeals. We feel that there's a good chance that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case. And part of the reason is that there's no constitutional issues. We're not asking this court, this very conservative Supreme Court, to create any new constitutional issues of rights for gay people. All we're asking them to do is resolve what is essentially an inter-agency dispute. It's more of a question of statutory construction. So, our petition was filed in that case at the end of January. The government's brief is due on Friday. And the new case clerk at the Supreme Court tells me that the Supreme Court will probably make a decision in three to four weeks after that. So we could be seeing a decision in that soon. Now here in the Ninth Circuit, the government filed a petition for what's known as a re-hearing on the bond. Meaning that they wanted the attention of the Supreme Court. Meaning that they wanted the attention of the Supreme Court. Meaning that they wanted the attention of the Supreme Court. And the entire Court of Appeals, the Ninth Circuit, to review that decision. And the Ninth Circuit refused to grant that petition. That came down January 17th. So, what we'll find, too, is that the government will undoubtedly be asking the Supreme Court to also review the same issue in the Carl Hill case. Part of the reason that they'll be inspired, I think, to ask for that review is because as a result of our victory at the lower court level, we filed a petition for attorney's fees in the amount of $340,000. We filed a petition for attorney's fees in the amount of $340,000. So, there's a little incentive for the government to appeal the case. In addition, on the congressional level, there's been some legislation that is going to be introduced by Barney Frank from Massachusetts. And we helped him draft that legislation which would change the exclusions so that it would eliminate the sexual deviance and psychopathic personality exclusions. So, there's a little incentive for the government to appeal the case. And we helped him draft that legislation which would change the exclusions so that it would eliminate the sexual deviance and psychopathic personality exclusions of gay people from the country. The next area I want to talk to you about is the military. The military has a absolute policy that gay people cannot serve. And the only exception to this policy is not really for the status of being gay, but someone who commits a homosexual sexual act. If they renounce that act, they'll say, Oh, Christ, was I drunk last night. I didn't know what I was doing. It was a mistake. It's never going to happen again. Please let me stay in the military. They can stay in. Other than that, everybody else is out. Now, the progress we've made in the last few years, at least at the discharge, will be under honorable conditions and will be entitled to full benefits. However, for somebody who's chosen to make a career of the service, this can still be pretty severe after you've been in for so many years to lose all the benefits in your particular chosen career. And to have the government say, Gee, well, you're not good enough to fight and die for your country, either. We have a test case pending the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals now involving a man who was originally stationed out here at Monterey, the Language Institute. That's Jim Jonenberg. He's a specialist in Korean cryptology. He had been in the service for nine years. Three months before his discharge, he had been given a $12,000 reenlistment bonus. He had had accommodation after accommodation after accommodation. They thought he was an excellent soldier until they found out he was gay. They kicked him out. The strategy of bringing the case in the District of Columbia was that, by reputation, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is the most liberal in the country. And in addition, the issue had been decided here in the Ninth Circuit some years ago by a case that we had brought and lost in a case that's known as Beller v. Lindendorf. And so there was no avenue available for redress here. And the strategy also would be that if we were able to get into the D.C. court, then that would resolve the issue for all soldiers. Because the issue of jurisdiction and venue revolved around where was the defendant located. It was our position that the Department of Defense and the headquarters of the Department of Navy were located in Washington, D.C. And the government fought us tooth and nail on this. In fact, two-thirds of their brief, they argued that the court didn't have jurisdiction. And essentially, for the merits of the case, all they did was say, well, another court out there in San Francisco decides the issue. And so it's really nothing but upset. Well, we won half that case. We won the jurisdiction issue. We lost on the merits. Now we're in the Court of Appeals, and our strategy we found backfired on us because the odds maybe were 1,000 to 1 of drawing three conservative judges in between three of the most conservative judges you could ever want to have. One of them started asking questions about did the right to privacy include the right to have sex with animals? And you have to start off at this level. You can't be too optimistic about the result. One of the other judges, who was a Reagan appointee to the bench, was a former professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School. And a student who did work for Gay Rock. He was a volunteer last summer. He had this judge as a professor for constitutional law. And when this man came to the issue of abortion rights, he said, I'm Catholic, and I have nine children, and that's enough said about abortion. Let's move on. So as you can see, we're not too optimistic about that case. It was a really great brief filed by the American Civil Rights Commission. It was a brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in that amicus parodic brief, or friend of the court brief. And what the ACLU did was to trace the rationale that the military uses for excluding gays. And they compared it to the same rationale that the military used to segregate blacks from the service. To say, look, white men are never going to sleep in the same barracks as black men. A white soldier is never going to sleep with a black soldier. How can a black maintain control and demand respect? And this is the same kind of thing they say about gays. About gays and lesbians in the service. That it just isn't going to work out. And what they're doing is trying to institutionalize some of these prejudices rather than trying to deal with the underlying problem. So it's a very good and very detailed brief and very enlightening. I hope the court takes some note of it. The paradox to what's going on in the military is that if you're a civilian employee of the military, there's almost... It's almost impossible to get rid of you. Regardless of what kind of activity you're involved in. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently held that a person who is a convicted child molester still cannot be discharged from the Navy absent a showing that there was some connection with his job duties in the Navy. What we call the nexus between his activity and his job requirements. So... Another area that we find the problem is that people who want to make a career out of the military, they make every effort to get rid of them as soon as they can. And those who want to get out, somebody discovers after they're in the service that they realize that their sexual orientation is not really what they thought it was and they come to their commanding officer and say, I'm gay. These people flounder around in the system often for a year or more before they're discharged. Even though the regulations are so mandatory. And... And... How we resolve that problem, I can't really say. But... It really is sort of a schizophrenic kind of attitude. Where they just can't make up their mind what they want. Other problems that we found now too is that the military, in some instances, are trying to prosecute soldiers for asking for a discharge. Saying that they enlisted fraudulently. That they knew at the time that they enlisted that they were gay. That their enlistment therefore was fraudulent. And they're trying to have them prosecuted. There's a case up on appeal in the 10th Circuit Court in Denver. And... It's been there for some time. So we should see a decision pretty soon in that case. Another thing that we find the military is doing now is suing people who've gone through ROTC. And apparently they have some kind of program where they subsidize their educational benefits. And the case that came before us last year, there was a person who went through medical school. Of course, he had the U.S. Army. And then when he finished, he said, I'm sorry, I can't do my six-year stint, not because I realize I'm gay. The Army said, well, I think we're going to have to sue you for $60,000 to reimburse us for the cost of your education. We were willing to defend this man, but he didn't have the desire to go through several years of litigation. It takes a lot of Ford to go through that. And what he did instead was file a bankruptcy. But... In any case, the military picked up the bill. Or for those of you who are working, I guess we all picked up the bill in a sense. Which leads me to the next thing that we've done is, based on some data we've collected over the last couple of years, we can make a pretty good estimate that the cost of separating gay people from the military is at least $20 million. So... The cost of separating gay people from the military is at least $20 million a year. That on average, the military separates about 1,800 soldiers a year from the service because of homosexuality. And that based on a recent RAND Corporation study, the cost of training a soldier through basic training in the first 22 weeks is $100,000. So... Simple arithmetic will show that that's $18 million. And my experience is most of the people that are being discharged have been around for a lot more than 22 weeks. What's the situation with conscription? Where somebody turns 19 and is supposed to go to the post office and says, I'm gay. How does the system deal with that? Well, you probably wouldn't necessarily tell the postmaster, but you would still have to register. And it wouldn't really become an issue until you were called up. And at that time, what happens is that you're given a questionnaire and asked you to list all of your childhood diseases and broken bones. And there's a square somewhere that says how you're afflicted with homosexual tenderness. What happens then, though? If you check the box and say you are so afflicted, then you will be deferred. You will not be taken or inducted into the military. You cannot be inducted into the military. If you do not check the box, you could be inducted. However, if you fraudulently, if you know that you're gay and you don't check that box, you are subject to penalties. You are subject to penalties of as much as five years in prison and $5,000 if they could subsequently prove the case against you. Let's talk about employment discrimination a little bit. Something that's been in the news just recently was AB1 finally passed both houses and sitting on Duke's desk waiting for a signature. What most people don't know in this state is that all that bill does is, codify a Supreme Court decision which already extends sexual orientation discrimination protection to all employers in the state. The only thing is that not all employees are covered. And this was the case of gay law students for specific telephone and telegraph. And I say it doesn't cover all employees because it only covers those employees who are open or out on the job. The employer's got to know that they're gay. Because part of what the Supreme Court of California said in that case was that being out on the job is political activity. And that in this state, an employer may not discriminate against an employee based on political activity. And political activity is much broader than partisan politics. It goes beyond the Democratic and Republican parties. It includes political causes, women's rights, labor union rights. Gay rights. So what the AB1 does is protect those people who are not out on their job, and it also gives them an administrative remedy by going through the Fair Employment and Housing Administration rather than having to file a suit directly in court. Other employment work that we're doing at Gay Rights Advocates, one involves a suit against an act named the Helms Bill in Oklahoma. The Helms Bill is essentially similar to the Briggs Initiative that was up here in California a few years back. Well, the Briggs Initiative was defeated here in California. It's law in Oklahoma. And we filed a suit challenging that bill, and we lost the district court level in Oklahoma. We have that case now up in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver. We had oral arguments last September, so we're looking for a decision any time now. The Helms Bill, if you recall, the main issue was First Amendment freedom of expression. That was the main cause of action. There was also, we raised, due process and equal protection arguments, as well as the right to privacy. And this kind of litigation, I'll tell you, for some of you who are law students and don't realize it, and the rest of you are not, we're often, quite frankly, flying by the seat of our pants. I mean, this is new. And when we're in the courts and we're making new law, the gay rights litigation that's going on in this country is essentially taking place in the last 10 to 15 years. Ten years ago, GRA didn't exist, and there weren't no gay legal organizations around the country. And most of the states still had sodomy laws in the books, and it's not uncommon to find all sorts of oppressive legislation in the books. So we don't have a lot to look toward in the courts. We have a lot to look toward in terms of precedents. We have to analogize a lot to the struggles that were won in the women's movement and the black movement and other First Amendment types of cases, the privacy decisions that came out of the abortion litigation and the contraceptive litigation. That's where we sort of draw from. Sometimes we make analogies, sometimes we just make up theories. You have to go in there. See, we feel, gay rights advocates, we have a very aggressive litigation posture. If we don't go into court and file suit, then we've lost before we've even started. There is, in a sense, nothing to lose by going into court because in the case of the Helmsville situation, the bill's on the books. And if we lose, the bill's still on the books. So what did we lose? But at least we go in there and fight. We have a chance of winning. And in addition, we feel there's some other benefits. There's educational benefits. There's consciousness raising. There's all the press we've got. We've engendered a lot of good press. People just cannot believe the situations I've been ascribing to you tonight about the military and immigration, these kind of things happening in America today in 1984. It's just incredible. And so we feel there's a certain value to bringing lawsuits, win or lose. And it's making a statement generally, too, that, you know, you've pushed this community around for just so long, and now it's your game, but we can play it, too, and we're going to be there, and we're going to fight, and we're going to win. But, you know, maybe we're not going to win all the time, but you're not going to knock us out of the ring because we're going to be right back there fighting every time. That's what gay rights advocates is all about. I didn't really follow up on your argument with regards to saying you arrested a person. I assume that that's something that you cannot be getting from the teacher. Well, actually, the law is so broad that it could exclude straight people as well because the language prohibits homosexual activity and homosexual conduct, neither of which is defined as engaging in what we would call homosexual sexual conduct. It's the mere mention, the mere discussing of homosexual rights could subject the teacher to a disciplinary hearing and a possible discharge from their employment. But the... The terms in the law are so vague and so general that it's hard to tell exactly what could be brought within the purview of the law. But essentially, it's expressions. It's talking about and discussing anything about homosexuality. What was the name of the case about gay law students versus Pacific Telephone Attorney? In regards to that case, it's probably, you know, between the type of Hopvent and AB1. It sounded... What I heard was that dismissing employees on those grounds is prohibited. Wouldn't AB1 also apply to job applicants and to promotion processes? It does Pacific Telephone and Telegram. It does. All types of employment, discrimination and promotions, fringe benefits, the hiring process, I haven't taken a look at it in a while. That's a whole other issue and I think that's sort of the issue in the 80s is the rights of gay couples. We're going to be doing some gay couple litigation. We did one case already and we have two pending now which I'll go into a little bit. There's one that we're going to do in Columbia, Maryland which involves the American Automobile Association and their motor club. They offer a discount to married couples but not to a gay couple or lesbian couple. And... Um... We're demanding that they extend that same benefit to gay couples. The case arose in Columbia, Maryland which is situated in Howard County. Howard County has a very broad anti-discrimination ordinance that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as marital status. Really this is sort of a marital status type discrimination as opposed to sexual orientation. However, gay people cannot be legally married anywhere in the country so it necessarily impacts on the gay community. So that's in the administrative process now and I think whoever loses that is probably going to appeal. So we're looking toward a long court battle out there. We have another case that's in sort of pre-adversary position right now down in Southern California in La Jolla where there's a gay couple that's been living together for six years. They have a relationship contract with the government. They have a contract that governs their relationship. And they also are having a dispute with AAA, this time with the automobile insurance. And AAA offers apparently a 20% spousal discount but this couple of course cannot qualify for that spousal discount. So we just might have to sue AAA on that issue as well. There are a number of areas where gay people, because they cannot be lawfully married, have fewer benefits, employment fringe benefits and taxation and so on, pension plans. And we don't necessarily, as I said earlier, expect to win all these cases, especially in the beginning. This is, what we're looking at is at least a 10 year program. But we're going to start raising the consciousness of the insurance industry. There are already at least two insurance carriers that I'm aware of that offer what they call domestic partnership or adult partnership. Or adult living companion. They have different euphemisms. But they offer the plan already. And I think essentially these discounts are marketing gifts. I don't think there's really any sound insurance reasons why they offer it. And so it's just going to be a matter of breaking it down. And when a few insurance carriers start offering the program and they find out that it's profitable, I think we'll find many more start offering it as well. Some other employment cases we're involved in, one involves a high school guidance counselor in Mad River, Ohio. Marjorie Rowland came out on her job and she didn't have her contract renewed simply because of her sexual orientation. She won at the district court level. Won an order for reinstatement and a $40,000 judgment for lost wages. And the school district appealed the case to the district court. She appealed the case to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. We had oral arguments on that case last June. So I think we'll be seeing a decision on that one pretty soon now too. In Minnesota, there's a judge there by the name of Robert Crane Winton who's been on the bench for about 19 years. And according to all his peers, he's a very able and competent judge. But he's being recommended for removal because he would not take a vow of celibacy. Crane Winton is gay. His sexual orientation came to light when he was arrested and charged with solicitation for prostitution, which he subsequently entered a plea to two misdemeanors, soliciting male prostitutes. Now, what makes the case an interesting one of discrimination is that two years earlier, a straight judge in Minnesota was arrested. He was arrested and pled out to the same charges with female prostitutes. He was given a reprimand and a $250 fine. Crane Winton has been ordered to pay a $46,000 fine and recommended for removal from the bench. And the straight judge was not asked to take a vow of celibacy. Now, the vow of celibacy comes from the fact that Minnesota has its own statute on prostitution. Most people think that sodomy statutes prohibit gay people from having sex. Well, what most people don't understand is that that same statute in virtually every state that has a sodomy statute prohibits all sexual activity other than between a husband and wife in a missionary position. So, even straight people are subject to the same law. In most states, it's a felony. And I'm telling you, these laws are enforced. In Nevada, a man was recently given 22 consecutive years. 22 consecutive life terms for committing the abominable crime against nature. And that case involved a teenager. And so you can say, well, okay, this is minors. It's not the same. I can assure you a straight man would have never received the same sentence. And in addition, another case I'm just aware of in Nevada where there was a scorned lover who called the police because he walked in on his lover having sex with another man. And the police came out. And they caught the people, what we say, flagrant delecto, in bed. This man was arrested. He was charged with sodomy. He was given a 20-year sentence. First offense. So, I'm telling you, these laws, they're in effect. They're enforced. And even more than that, they're something that we are attacking around the country because they're a great psychological barrier to attaining gay rights in this country. It's sort of the bedrock. The bedrock of discrimination. How can we give employment protection to criminals? And the city council sit around and debate extending civil rights orders to protect people on the basis of sexual orientation saying, how can we give civil rights protection to criminals? So, this is the kind of thing that we have to get rid of in these sodomy laws. We have participated recently in a national conference of some other gay organizations and sponsored by the National American Civil Liberties Union in New York last fall where we are going to put together a strategy attacking the remaining 25 sodomy statutes in this country. We're going to go after them one by one and knock them off. We're going to figure out what's the best form. Do we want to be in the state court? Do we want to be in the federal court? What is the correct time? What is the correct mode for attacking these cases? Is it going to be in the criminal context? Is it going to be a civil challenge? All right. And we're going to go after these statutes and we're going to get rid of them. There was a significant victory in sodomy challenge litigation last year in the case of Baker v. Wade which came out of the U.S. District Court in Dallas, Texas which ruled that that sodomy statute in Texas was unconstitutional. The Amarillo District Attorney decided to appeal that decision even though the State Attorney General did not. That case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit of New Orleans and oral arguments have been scheduled for the second week in March. That case I feel quite certain will also be appealed to the Supreme Court regardless of who wins. Now what happened in that case, it's sort of a new twist, was that at the Court of Appeals level the District Attorney said, we've got to have a sodomy statute. We've got to have a sodomy statute on the books because we needed to control AIDS. Well, the time that that sodomy statute was passed, I assure you, nobody had ever even heard of AIDS. And furthermore, the State and the District Attorney did not litigate the AIDS issue at the trial level. And so it was our position at the Court of Appeals level that it's too late. We cannot bring up a new issue for the first time at the Court of Appeals level. That same argument is being made in sodomy challenge to the law in Georgia. And there the case is on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The other case that's pending now that could have some impact, quite considerable impact in fact, on sodomy litigation in the future is a case which is presently before the U.S. Supreme Court. This is the Uplinger case which came out of State and District. A couple of years ago, by way of background, the New York Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in that state, struck down the sodomy statute in New York. They said it was unconstitutional. The State applied for a writ of cert to the U.S. Supreme Court. They asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to grant the writ. So the court action became final. What they still have left on the books was a law which made it illegal to ask somebody to engage in deviant sexual behavior, what they called voidering for solicitation of deviant sexual behavior, which is defined as sodomy. So when a man named Robert Uplinger was arrested and charged under that statute, the end result in the court was, well, if it's perfectly lawful to engage in the act, why should it be illegal to ask somebody to engage in the act? And they struck down the solicitation statute also. This time, the district attorney in Buffalo appealed the decision or asked for a writ of cert to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court granted it. And the speculation was that the reason they granted it was that they had changed their mind about the Onofre case, and they really wanted to review the underlying issues of the sodomy legislation in New York. And in fact, that was an argument that was made in the petition by the DA. Now, some events happened since that petition was filed, and when the final brief was filed for the state of New York, the district attorney in Buffalo, he did not argue that the sodomy statute needed to be reconsidered. And an interesting twist, too, was that the attorney general of the state of New York, Robert Abrams, filed an amicus brief supporting the decision of the New York Court of Appeals that the law was not constitutional. So you had, in effect, the state's attorney general and a city DA on opposite sides of the same issue. NGRA filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court, arguing that the petition was impromptly granted and that they would just throw the whole thing out without deciding it. And what we're hoping is that they are not going to read the underlying issues, because, for one thing, they're not properly before the court. It wasn't before the court. It wasn't an issue in the lower court decision. And, secondly, that we're not adequately briefed because of evidence that was not an issue. Oral arguments have already been presented in that case. We're expecting a decision later this spring. And depending on what happens in that case, it could have a significant impact on litigation for a good number of years to come. Another area of litigation that's going on is in the area of security clearances. Security clearances are necessary for people, many people who work for the government or work for private industry that do contracts with the government, generally in the areas of energy and defense. And what security clearance means is that the government says that you are okay to look at classified information and feel that you're not going to default this information. There's different levels of security clearances. Gay people, over the years, have had a great deal of problems getting security clearances. And what we found is that the government's policy on this is somewhat inconsistent. They do not have an interagency plan or set of guidelines or criteria. Each agency decides on its own. And there's an awful lot of discretion that can be exercised. What we found is a recent trend where in many agencies, a person can get a security clearance. Some agencies, so-called, intelligence agencies, I call them the police agencies, the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, are hanging in there tough, and they will not grant security clearances to anybody that they know is gay. There's been some recent litigation against the CIA. There's one case that was filed more than a year ago in the District of Columbia District Court. It's before Judge Barrington Parker. And he's been sitting on motions for summary judgment in that case for more than a year now. There was a recent case filed in Los Angeles, the U.S. District Court down there, involving John Green, who was an engineer with a company known as TRW. He's worked for TRW, I believe, for 13 years. And he's never had any problems. The CIA, in fact, has never said that he leaked any information, divulged any information. But basically what they said was that he was gay and that he was subject to blackmail when he was gay. And therefore, like, divulged information for that argument breaks down and the person says, I'm not subject to blackmail. I'm open about my sexuality. My family knows. My friends know. It's no big deal to me. I don't know why it's a big deal to you. But to the CIA, it's still a big deal. And they can't, they just cannot understand why there might be some kind of, or might not be some kind of problem here. So that case is pending in the U.S. District Court. The government just yesterday filed a motion to dismiss. They said the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case based on solemn immunity. They said the government did not consent to be sued in this case. And they also said that the judiciary would be infringing on the executive branch of government by getting involved in this matter. They said the CIA had absolute discretion to decide who gets the security clearance and who does not. So there will be a responsible treaty filed on that on March 2nd. Thank you. Thank you. I'll talk only about two more issues. One is briefly some First Amendment cases that we're involved in. We find that a number of gay community newspapers like here in San Francisco, we have the Bay Area Reporter, are being censored at a number of prisons around the country. Prisons that want to keep in touch with their gay communities are not being allowed to read these papers. So we're going to be involved in a suit probably and do for a lot of the congressional correctional institute in Kentucky and maybe one here at the Lompoc prison and possibly one down in Texas as well. And then last thing that I want to talk about is the rights of gay students. I went to, well, I went to several undergraduate schools. I graduated from Michigan State University, which is where I first got involved in gay political causes. And as a student, I brought a suit against the university for refusing to allow us to place a banner on the two official posts, shall we say, of the university where you can announce events. And Michigan State University is on a main thoroughfare with 40,000 cars a day past students' intersections. We wanted to put a banner that said Gay Pride Week and the administration wouldn't let us. So we filed an action against the university and we didn't win, but it was probably because we weren't adequately prepared because we found out from sort of some of our sources, post-administration, that they had been warned by their lawyers not to do that again next year because they were probably in some pretty serious trouble. And so the next year, we made an application to put up the banner and we ended up without any problems. Now this same school, sitting in a city that has an anti-discrimination ordinance, which I helped lobby for in 1971, last year they allowed that gay students to be kicked out of fraternities simply because he was gay. So even though you have an anti-discrimination ordinance, it's not going to be worth a whole lot and it's not enforced. So there are continuing problems going on. We found that there's a school, another school mission, called Andrews College, which is trying to kick out two students because they alleged they were gay. There's a private college in the suburb of Chicago that once ran a bachelor's degree to a student who's completed all of his coursework and said this person's gay and doesn't meet the criminal character requirements of our school and he can't handle his degree. We find that the University of Arkansas in Batesville, the school has official, granted official university recognition to the student organization there, but they won't grant them any office space or any funding or any of the benefits that might go along with official recognition. There's two cases going on in Texas right now involving the rights of students to get recognition at their campus. And my last big gay rights case before I came to the West Coast involved the lawsuit against Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. because they would not grant recognition to the undergraduate and to the law school gay student organizations. So there are still a lot of lawsuits involving students as well as many other areas that are important. We can become complacent here in California. It doesn't have a sodomy statute anymore. We have a lot of protections. People to a great extent may be a lot more relaxed. They're used to hearing about seeing a gay community. It's sort of this old hat. But in most parts of the country, there's still a lot of problems. And that's what National Gay Rights Advocates is all about. It's writing this number that's impacting the rest of the country. Is Gay Rights Advocates taking on any cases involving gay youth and their rights to their sexuality if they have not reached any consent? Because that seems to be something in California that is sort of an issue. And it's a very complicated issue. Yeah, there's a lot of problems in that area. We have not taken on any cases involving that issue. I can't say we've been presented with any. What we do in determining what cases to take is we basically wait for people to come to us, which is not much of a problem. I get calls every day. If a day doesn't go by, they don't get at least one call, so they can think about some kind of discrimination or adverse action. But that particular issue hasn't reached us yet. The thing that you do talk about is in housing, screenwriters have been pointing out that this city, Denver, has a law that says 200 million individuals cannot live together. And this is often used against gay couples. What's the status of that? Has anything been done about it? We haven't had any complaints in a long time about that kind of problem. That is a way of certainly discriminating against gay people without being so forthright as saying that we're not going to allow two gay people to live together. The history of that, kind of like, the legislation, I'm not so sure was necessarily anti-gay, but was intended to keep noise down and to protect sort of family-type environments. But it certainly hasn't had an impact on gay people. Some areas like that, it's very subtle with the legislation. Some states, like Virginia, it's very blatant.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.32, "end": 14.86, "text": " The United States Constitution does not mention sexual freedom, but the United
