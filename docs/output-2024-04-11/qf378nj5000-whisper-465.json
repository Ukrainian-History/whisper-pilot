{"text": " My name is Elvira Prieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here. I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school. My name is Eva Silva, I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom. And I'm from Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado. I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano studies. I'm from a town in San Diego called Escondido, and um, what else, that's it for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna, I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education. And um, I'm from Burbank, California. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. I'm going to be a social studies high school teacher. Do you want to ask some questions here as to how this started and how they... In your own words, how did it start? How did this hunger strike start and why? How did it start? Speak to us as if we don't know. Okay. Speak to me... Well, I guess it was a build up of a lot of things. of a lot of different things that have been happening, not only on this campus, but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States, in the universities and everywhere else. So, you know, I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have happened, the closing down of the Office of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the threats with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers, and just these attacks on the theme houses on the ethnic centers and everything else, and then the laying off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean, everything just like piled on, piled on, and so many things were happening that we said, wait, we need to do something about it, and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening that we want to happen. I'm tired. I'm sorry. No, you sound good. Some people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this. Some people say why didn't you? Because the administration has been very, and whenever we've had like meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever, get togethers with any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with. And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing and just the way that people in East Palo Alto are that it was maybe the only way that they would, I don't know if it would touch their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it because otherwise they weren't paying attention. It was just like everything had to go business as usual, and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down. It was what they said first, and then if we could deal with that, if we as students could deal with what the university, what the university wanted, well, then that was fine. And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because, you know, they earned it or whatever. Yeah, because meeting after meeting, like, you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time. It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7. I'll give you a meeting from 5.30 to 6 or whatever. We've tried their methods. We've tried their methods of working things out, and their methods are two to draw things out for as long as possible in order to not give us things. At least, you know, they may say differently, but that's what it feels like, and it's ridiculous to have to spend, I'm sorry I'm slow, but I'm a little bit tired. It's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things, and, you know, they're trying to tire us out with just talking. So that's what it had to come to, and, you know, when people are not heard, and this happens in society at large, when people are not heard, yeah, you know, I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors, but, you know, behaviors that are not normal, you know, behaviors that are not normal are what happen, and, yeah, this is not normal. You know, this is not normal behavior for us to be, you know, not eating, but, but, you know. I really like to eat. Yeah, we like to eat, and, you know, it just, so I emphasize, you know, why are Chicanos in prison? Why are Chicanos, you know, in poverty? That's not normal. That's not normal for people, but because of society, that's how we are. And we've waited long enough for this. I mean, I know the administration is probably thinking, well, you know, be patient, and these changes will happen, but we've been patient long enough, and, you know, the Chicano Studies major has been, it was envisioned back in, back in the 70s, even the 60s, and, you know, it's not, you know, it's not, you know, and we've been waiting since then, and it's about time that we get recognized, you know. Chicanos are the biggest, are coming to be a majority in California and, you know, maybe even in the whole country after a while, but, I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized and that other people just, just realize that we're not going to go away, and if they don't educate themselves about us, then we're not going to be able to do anything. It's just going to be worse for them. Julia, you co-authored a really beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres. What, for you, is the significance of having four Chicanos taking the vanguard role in this, this movement, which is really bigger than this campus? For me, I mean, I don't know. We didn't really realize it was four women until somebody pointed it out to us. I don't, I mean, we knew it was girls, but we didn't see it, like, you know, oh, you know, there's no guys here, and, you know, like, you know, what's up with the guys? But, I don't know. I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male, and maybe they didn't say they were going to go for the long run, but they've been, you know, there the whole time. Yeah, everybody, like, has, has, has their roles, and it's, like, there's some people that are the negotiators. There's people that are security over here. There's, like, everybody has their roles, and, you know, we're, we're not the, we're not the, you know, the most important, because if it wasn't for them, then, you know, nobody would be listening to us, or whatever. And there's other people that have been fasting also, like Felipe, do you know him, Barragan? He's been fasting these three days with us as well, and, like, there's people that committed to three days, and others that do one, one day cycles to show their support and solidarity. It's true, there are, there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying, you know, like, with the rest of the women, also trying to take care of us, and trying to watch out for this, and they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need, or what needs to be done for the whole group. And so it's, I don't know, I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting, or anything like that, I don't know. Yeah, because I think... Because everybody, everybody really does have their own role, and everybody's been really supportive, and we're, we're working together. It's really actually, it's just so, yeah, it just so happened that we're the ones that, that, you know, we're the ones that, that, you know, we're ready mentally at this time to, to fast, and, you know, it just so happens that we're all women. Yeah, people are calling us guerrilleras, and revolucionarias, and all that. I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's fine, I think. That's nice, you know, it's really, that's really nice, but, I mean, everybody, you know... Everybody's been revolutionary. And, you know, it's, it comes down to, like... The focus should be on everybody. Yeah, it comes down to, like, what your, you know, I don't want to say your talent is, because we're, I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but... But pretty much, like, everybody has taken on the role that, that is best suited for themselves, and... I don't know if that's it. Yeah. There, there you go. There's Felipe. There's Felipe. You know, of all the things that you could have done, of all the actions you could have taken, why fasting? Why did you choose to fast? Why did you choose to fast? Well, it's obviously a really strong statement. You know, it's something that, it's uncompromising, and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people way before us, you know, have fought for, and we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had, those, that vision they had, is fulfilled. We can't just, you know, it may be 20 years, 20, 30, 20, or 20 years later from the, you know, the Chicano movement that people think is dead, but it's not dead. We're here, and we're living, and we're the Chicano movement. And Chicana movement. Yeah. Chicano, Chicana, Chicano movement. Felipe, you just joined us, but actually, you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning as, as was pointed out. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from, and your reflection on this struggle? Sure. My name is Felipe Barayan. I'm a freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California. This struggle, I think, for me, it's something that's very important, because I went to high school in Watts, and a lot of people know what Watts is like, 1965, Watts Rebellion, the 92 riots. There I saw issues that the educational system for high school students and Chicanos, Latinos there wasn't addressing the real issues. Once I came here, I got a taste of it. I got a taste of Chicano studies, and I found out how crucial that was. And I think that getting involved with the struggle is important for me to build the processes with which we learn to deal with inner city, to wipe out the, you know, marginalization of our people. You know, in terms of your actions, you know, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study, and that you should be in the classroom, not, you know, protesting. And so you're making a decision, because it is a pretty tough university to be at, and there's a lot of demands, and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance. How, you know, how did you make that decision? See, I guess, like, the main thing is, is, like, I never, like, when I came here, I didn't want to come and just study and go to class and go back home, study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself. While there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools, there's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly, there's kids being born without hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on, because, you know, that's my people, that's my parents, that's my family, that's, you know, everybody. And I wouldn't be able to live with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done. And... And also, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it. Today we had, you know, little Chicanitas and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out and from a group called Traices de Mexico, and they came out and they're, you know, they came out and supported us. You know, they're just little kids, you know, I don't know. They're probably like from five to like 12 maybe. And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or, you know, study hours or whatever is so that they, when they come here, you know, they can focus, you know, on doing the things that they need to do instead of having to struggle so much. I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know. They struggle so that we don't have to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we don't. Struggle. We're still struggling, but at a different level. You know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry. Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about where am I going to get something to eat, like before, or how are we going to pay the bills. We're probably going to have to, you know, we're probably going to be able to pay even our parents' bills. Hopefully, yeah. Yeah, I think it also. Teachers still don't teach your salary. But I think it also goes back to the question about where, why did we choose a hunger strike. It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this, and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA, you know. As we could have, and I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable of doing a work. But we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else because our issues are so important. And I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that. But I don't know if anybody sees that. But I mean, you know, I know that I could be a nice student, you know. But I, you know, I choose to better be like, to be a human being first, and to care more about my people than about my grades. I was going to ask you, you know, related to the incident that happened on Sunday at the Flix, at the film Notary's show. How do you, how do you feel, or what steps can the university take to educate the student, the student community, even staff and faculty, about the issue of, you know, ongoing racism, the issue of why it's important to have abandoned graves on this campus? How do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community? I think if they really, truly believe that that isn't right, that the incident at Flix isn't right, or that people should know and should be, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong, then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university. If they really feel responsible for the education of their students, if they really, if they believe that that is an important issue, that people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students finding that amusing, there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level or something of the students at this university and they are responsible because they're the administrators. They're in charge of this school. They're here to serve the students and, but they're also here to help educate them and there's, I mean, to me, that proved just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me and, but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful and if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it. I mean, the main things that were, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about, you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time and, you know, one of them being a campus ban on grapes, the development of a Chicano studies program and the community center in East Palo Alto and, you know, these are things that we can talk about specifically. And our food. Oh, yeah. And the offer for a high-level position for Cecilia Bulciaga, a high-level administrator here, Chicano administrator. Why is it important to, for the university to recognize Cecilia's contributions? Why is Cecilia's position, Cecilia's role included among these other three? Well, basically because it ties down to the whole, you know, approach that we're taking that our education isn't addressing the real issues, you know, the issues being poverty, the joblessness and, you know, the over-representation we have in the jails and just everything. And she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues. She's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Grapes campaign and, I mean, and when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here. I mean, she's like a role mother, a role model. Oh, man, I can't, I'm getting tired. Oh, no, you're, what's, yeah, what we're talking about, she's a role, she's a role model and a role mother. She's a mother figure. That's it, that's it. No, I guess basically because she helps in just keeping us here because it's hard to survive in a campus like this when you have people like Sunday nights at Flick saying Beaners go home or, you know, saying stuff like that here at Stanford. I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us, that you have to justify your existence? And you need people like Cecilia Bustiaga and like Frances that just, you know. Yeah. Help you out just to make, like, especially the transition from like your first year, I mean, that's what helped me so much living in Zapata my very first year is, you know, I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think, because, I mean, she helped out a lot, like with my parents and just everything. I mean, I think, like, they're always caring for you. She's an important contact for us. I mean, there's so few of us here and then there's so few, you know, Chicano and Chicana role models here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know, this happened to me today or, you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home where I see a lot of people who look like myself, you know, and these are people that you can talk to. Like Cecilia, you know, she's, I mean, I find it incredible. She always has time to hear us out, always. Yeah, when I was a freshman, like, I have a really nice story about her that when I, well, I didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year and so, so, like, I had a lot of problems, like, just trying to adapt and trying to, trying to decide, like, what I was going to do with my life and I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting because I didn't really want to go to my family or do what I really wanted to do was to be a teacher and my freshman advisor risen recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me. And I remember going into her office and just, like, crying my guts out because I didn't know what, I didn't know where I fit into this university. And she talked, she had time, like, she sat with me in her office and talked to me what I felt was right, you know, that to let my heart decide. And, I mean, for the university not to recognize that she is capable of, like, keeping me here because I was ready to leave. And she literally made me, helped me to stay. And if it wasn't for her, I mean, I wouldn't be here. All of you are members of METCHA, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano. That's long history. What is the significance of this new phase? And I'm referring specifically to the various events that started at UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Colorado, University of Colorado, and Michigan State. Virginia, too. Virginia, too. Can you talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence of METCHA and Chicano Student Activism? I think as METCHA is the Chicano Student Movement, and there's a long history of activism there, dating back to the original plan, the Plan de Santa Barbara. And I think that each of us has maintained that goal of the betterment of la raza. And our METCHA is very strong, and we support. Thank you. And the first founding, METCHAistas, came up with in terms of the Plan de Santa Barbara. And it's gaining, in UCLA, and UC Santa Barbara, and other universities, METCHA members and other organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands. I think it's playing an instrumental role. They got misquoted? They're going to print tomorrow. Are they in support? Yeah. We're rolling. So what happened? They're going to print it. They're going to print it tomorrow. That sucks, man. Okay. I feel bad for . Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I was going to ask you. I know earlier I talked to, you know, your dad, and I talked to your mom. And I know from them that it's been really hard for them. I mean, they haven't been eating as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're eating too much. They're also, in a way, also hungry. How do you feel about your parents' role in this? How are you going to explain it to your parents once it's over and you haven't really explained it to them, like courage and that kind of thing? Well, I tell them. My biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the fast was how my mom was going to take it because I thought she was going to, you know, get . . . Yeah. was going to, you know, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick because anytime she stresses out, she has really bad attacks and stuff. And I just, I just knew I was going to worry her and I was going to hurt her. And that was the thing that scared me the most. But I talked to her about it and I kind of eased her into it. I started telling her first about the plan to stay out of the quarter and stuff like that. And she was like, well, she told me, um, before I even mentioned to her that I was going to fast, she said, well, Mija, when you are leading, when you are a leader and you are, want to take part in changing things when they're bad, sometimes you have to make sacrifices. She said, and you know, whatever happens, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support. And so then when I told her, she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was getting, you know, thought that I was going to get to that because I told her and she was like, well, she said, I'm not going to tell you to do it and I'm not going to tell you not to do it because I don't want to, I don't want to feel responsible for you doing it. And I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe it, you know, it didn't succeed or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want to do what you wanted to. She said, but I'm really scared. But she said that she had faith in God and as long as I had faith in God, that everything was going to be okay. And so for me, it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone, I decided this is, I really felt strongly about it already. And I decided that this was something I was going to do. And even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain, that I was going to get through it and that she was going to get through it. And I'm, I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either. And I haven't been able to speak with her since, since that last time I talked to her. But, but like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already past her youth and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore. And she said, it's our turn. And so here we are, we're trying to make changes because I don't want to, I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this. And I have a younger sister who's here also, and I don't want her to have to, you know, continue this. I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here. But, you know, if I could, if I can help out in some way, so that, you know, the kids that come here later don't have to be going through this, then that would be awesome. So, yeah. I have a question. How has the university administration Okay, I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well. It's like, I, I knew, like when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it. I wanted to be part of the hunger strike. I, I just knew that I could do it. And I, I was gonna have the willpower to go through with it. But the only thing was my mom. I didn't know, I didn't know how to tell her. I didn't know what to tell her. I was scared. Cause I know that the way my mom is, she worries and she doesn't sleep that night and she can't eat. And it's just, it's bad. I hate it. I don't, I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything. But, I don't know, it's just something I felt so, so deeply. From my heart, I just thought, you know, so many people are gonna gain a lot from this. So many people are gonna, you know, have a lot of things come out of this, especially like with the East Palo Alto Community Center and with the, the boycott on the graves. It's just immediate like help for, for people that are practically, that are dying and, you know, being born with birth defects. So, when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it. She was telling me I'm anemic, that I was anemic. Then my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count. And they were just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing it because I was so skinny and I was gonna disappear and this and that. So then, oh, sorry. So then, after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard. She was crying and everything. And, and then I called her after the first day of the, of the hunger strike. And she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone. So that, that was just made me, I was just crying. I was talking to my sister and my sister was, you know, I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry. Tell her that I'm feeling good. The issues are keeping me alive and they're gonna keep me alive and I'm gonna be okay. So, but she's gonna come today because she's, she's worried and she wants to see me. Well, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, you know, to be able to talk to her. So, to tell my mom and dad, you know, that I was gonna do this, because like we've all said, you know, we don't want to make them suffer. But I told her and she said, you know, okay, well, if you guys are still out there after three days, then I'm gonna come out. And then the right, like, a few minutes before I left, I was talking to her, y me estaba dando la bendición. Do I have to translate that? Oh, okay. And then, and then, so, you know, she was, she was crying and I could tell and she was giving me la bendición. And so she was like, you know what, I'm gonna be out there tomorrow and stuff. And, you know, my mom and dad got some money together and then, so my mom could fly out here and stuff. And so she, she came out last night and, I mean, I think it was better for her to come because she, you know, she was upset when she saw me and she was crying and stuff. But, you know, she's been really good and everybody's been really supportive of her and she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful. Yeah. To this, to this thing. She feels a part of, a part of this strike and, you know, she feels a part of the movement and, you know, I think that, you know, she is because, you know, we're fighting, I'm fighting for her and for everybody. And, you know, she slept out there with us last night. So, she's hardcore. For me, that, that was definitely the hardest part because, and after I did it, I was, I wish that I didn't, that I didn't have to, but I know that I'm gonna be able to do it. I'm gonna be able to do it. Yeah. And I know that I, that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her if she had found out some other way. So, I'm just really worried about her because she has heart problems and I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something, you know, , you know, everything would be worse. But, but, you know, she's fine and, and she already told me that she supports me and, and even though it's the, the hardest thing, you know, for her, she knows, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight. And maybe that'll, hopefully that made her feel a little bit better, but maybe, hopefully, I don't know. I don't know exactly how she is. Our last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak. And my dad called me, like, the next morning, the morning after I told my mom, and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it. He told me all kinds of things. And he told me, why do you want to, why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight? Why do you want to fight? to go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers in your life and just reminding me of all the things that i've had to go through just to get where i am and trying to tell me well don't you know don't do it but i still did it and he's here right now and he came and told me he's still trying to convince me to stop because he goes he says if you know your mom's gonna come up here tomorrow and if you're still on the strike she's gonna strike with you so i don't know um i think generally my parents um have the same feelings as all of theirs do um but it's a little bit easier for them to handle because tonight's gonna be my last day fasting so that's basically it last word um well okay you said it's for historical purposes right so when um you know 20 years from now when other chicano's look at this and chicana and chicana sorry i'm tired um you know another hint to see this um just to remember that you know even when you're looking at this now 20 years later the movement is still alive in you and we still have to keep struggling because you know well hopefully we can stop hopefully we can stop some of it but i mean if it's still if it's still bad you know 20 years from now you know we can do it you know yeah and don't take advantage of what you know what you have i guess like like for us it's very important to to say oh we have we have el centro and there's a lot of people that worked hard for it don't settle for what you don't settle for what you have and don't forget us pretty much don't forget the people who fought before you all the things like the people that fought before us and and before us and before them and just remember we're you know we're doing this for you for for the future thank you my name is okay the new message is this it is currently about 7 30 on the 6th of may friday 1994 we have just uh collected uh witnessed the five testimonials from from uh five of the of the hunger strikers which have included um at one point over 100 solidarity strikers uh and uh otheriell some who also are clean people so we are going to be partnering with c possession for more during weekend and weekendằ� uh blocking i guess something in the�를 you know they've been uh quite busy over this one um isn't it nice to give it back uh to these isso young people you know people that you know ch casey may or may don't even probably be children we're working on a statement to discuss more of a collaborative strategy starting at the re calcitung we've actually put together a number of uh statement brooks we haven't had to take that on in some with us, has opened or begun to open the administration's eyes to the justness of our cause and our demands. However, as I said, there still is some work to be done. For the moment, it seems as though our first demand, that is the offering of a high-level position to Associate Dean Cecilia Bursiaga, is still not being met. And, as I said, this is our first demand and it is very important to us, so more negotiation has to go on with regards to that. The second demand involves the establishment of a community center in East Palo Alto to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university. And as far as the university is administrated, it is not. As far as the administration is concerned, they are receptive to the initiative that the Chicano and Chicana students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy. This has been a very important component to the struggle here. As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new. It goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara, which inaugurated METCHA. So, we are very hopeful that some breakthrough will come through here. As regards to the Chicano and Chicana studies, again, this is the justness and the feasibility of this demand has led the administration to also give overtures that are encouraging. Finally, the issue of grapes on campus has, and specifically the negative reactions that racist reactions to our efforts to educate the community at Stanford has, and our protests against those negative reactions, has led the university to embark upon an initiative to educate all the dorms through the showing of the No Grapes video and also through establishing a dialogue with our community, the Chicano community, in an effort to bridge the gaps that have been caused, bridge the divisions that have been caused by the racism that's very often a result of an academy which is very hierarchical and one which is institutionally and structurally hostile to the presence of minorities and other marginalized people. With this, I would just like to say, que viva la raza y adelante. We're going to win this. We're going to win this one. We're going to win this one.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 29.0, "text": " My name is Elvira Prieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here.", "tokens": [50365, 1222, 1315,
