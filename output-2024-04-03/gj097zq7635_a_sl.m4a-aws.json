{"language": "en-US", "transcript": "The United States constitution does not mention sexual freedom. But the United States Supreme Court whose main job is to interpret the constitution has found that the constitution does provide a right to privacy and self determination. The court has not defined this right very clearly, but it does recognize the right to, for instance, an abortion within limits and the right to use and receive information about contraceptives. According to the Supreme Court. The basis for this right comes from the protections of the Bill of Rights. Uh for instance, the First Amendment's freedom of religion, freedom of speech and freedom of association. The Third amendment's protection of each citizen's home from the quartering of soldiers in peacetime. The fourth amendment's protection of each citizen's person and home against unreasonable search and seizure. The fifth amendment's protection against self incrimination and the ninth amendment's protection from governmental infringement of certain unspecified rights of the people. It's uh both fortunate and unfortunate those rights have not been specified. Um Besides finding this right to privacy, the Supreme Court has indicated that groups considered to be what they call discrete and insular minorities such as racial and ethnic groups need special protection under the constitution, particularly to ensure that they have equal access to this nation's political and governmental processes. So with all these protections, why hasn't the Supreme Court upheld the rights of gays and lesbians to live and work without discrimination? The answer is not because of any lack of cases. The court ducked a number of gay rights issues in the 19 seventies and we go out of one Virginia case in 1976 by affirming the lower court decision without hearing any arguments or giving any reasons. In short, the Supreme Court has hoped the issue of gay rights would go away. Why? Well, because with all of these other holdings, setting the trend, the court would appear extremely inconsistent if it decided against gay rights and yet, if it decided in favor of gay rights, despite negative public opinion, the court might undermine its authority and jeopardize its ability to enforce unpopular rulings. After all, the United States Supreme Court has no army to back up its decisions. Nor does it have control of federal funds with which to coerce compliance. Another possible reason for the court's reluctance to handle gay rights cases is that the court's two liberal members, Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan fear they would be outvoted on the issue and they've been delaying gay rights cases because they fear a bad decision would be worse than no decision if Brennan and Marshall are stalling for a time when the court will be more liberal. It is doubtful they will live long enough. Brennan is 77 Marshall is 75 and in poor health and if Reagan is re-elected, we probably will have an extremely conservative Supreme Court for the rest of this century. So tonight, we have asked Leonard Graf, the legal director of national gay rights advocates to tell us what cases are pending in the nation's courts, including the Supreme Court this year. And what the chances are that 1984 will be a major year in the history of gay rights for better or for worse national gay rights advocates, which is based in San Francisco is a private nonprofit law firm that acts as a clearing house for a large number of gay rights cases throughout the nation. It is similar to the American Civil Liberties Union and then it finds lawyers nationwide who are willing to donate their time to specific cases as legal director for the past year and a half. Leonard Graf coordinates those legal efforts. They're all yours. Thank you very much. I'm pleased to be here tonight to talk to you about the, uh, current gay rights litigation that's going on around the country. And, um, what I'd like to do is sort of break it down by different categories and rather than lecture, I just assume, make it more of a discussion. So if you have questions as I'm going along, feel free to raise your hands and, and interrupt. Um, I understand that a few number of you are, are not law students. And so I'll try to, um, to keep my terms as, uh general and in the lay, uh, language as possible if you don't understand something I'm talking about. Um, please let me know and I'll try to explain it the best I can. I'd like to start out first talking about an area which is very important to, uh, gay rights advocates. It's an issue we've been working on for about five years and that's the immigration naturalization issue. And what I'll probably do is conclude with uh an issue which I think many of you will find important, which is the uh rights of gay students in this country. And uh by no means is this issue settled at all in the uh area of integration naturalization. We won gay rights advocates a very important victory in the, um US district court in the northern district of California. Uh in the ca case of Carl Hill versus INS and the immigration Nationality Act prohibits homosexuals from entering the country. However, you don't find the word homosexual anywhere in that act. What you find is the Supreme Court decision, which has interpreted the language of the act to exclude homosexuals. And the uh precise terminology that they interpreted was psychopathic personality. Since gay people are equipped with a psychopathic personality, they must be excluded from the country. Now, the question is which we raised in the Carl Hill cases, how do you determine who is a homosexual? It is our position to gay rights advocates that the only way to make this determination under the law is through an examination by a public health service doctor and that doctor must examine the arriving alien and say to that alien to our gay issue with what is known as a class a certificate and then the ins can exclude the person from the country. Now, the government's position is that a person is able to decide for themselves whether or not they're gay and if they say they're gay, they are gay and can be excluded from the country. This is the issue. The US District Court here in the northern district of California agree with gay rights advocates that a doctor's certificate from the public health service must issue the case involved Carl Hill who was a tourist who was here for pleasure and a journalist, a photographer for a London newspaper, a newspaper. Now the same issue ro uh rose again in the case of Richard Longs staff, which is a case that we have just filed a petition for review in the United States Supreme Court. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals decision, the Fifth Circuit sits in New Orleans. Mr Longs staff is a resident of Dallas Texas. He's been here about 20 years now. He came here on a valid immigrant visa. He subsequently opened up two boutiques clothing stores and uh hairdressing salons. He employs about 20 citizens of this country. He pays over $100,000 a year in income taxes. And our government has said to Richard Longs staff, you're not good enough to be an American citizen. Why has our government said that? Because Richard Long's staff is gay and that is the position that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld. So what we have now is a clear conflict between two circuits. I I might have skipped over the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals here has a firm decision of Carl Hill. What we did is file a petition to the Supreme Court asking them to review the Fifth Circuit decision and to resolve the conflict between the two different courts in appeals. We feel that there's a good chance that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case. Um And part of the reason is that there's no constitutional issues. We're not asking this court, the very conservative Supreme Court to create a new constitutional issues of rights for gay people. All we ask them to do is resolve what is essentially an interagency dispute. And uh it's a, it's more of a question of statutory construction. So our petition was filed in that case. At the end of January, the government's brief is due on uh Friday and the new case or at the Supreme Court tells me that the uh Supreme Court will probably make a decision of 3 to 4 weeks after that. So we could be seeing a decision in that soon. Now, here in the Ninth Circuit, the, um, the government filed a petition for what's known as a rehearing on the bond, meaning that they wanted the entire court of appeals for the ninth circuit to review that decision. And the Ninth Circuit refused to grant that petition that came down January 17th. So what we'll find too is that the government will undoubtedly be asking the Supreme Court to also review the same issue in the Carl Hill case. Uh, part of the reason that we, they'll be inspired, I think to, uh, ask for that review is because as a result of our victory at the lower court level, we filed a petition for attorney's fees in the amount of $340,000. So there's little incentive for the government to appeal the case. Um In addition, on the, on the congressional level, there's been some legislation, um, that is going to be introduced by Barney Frank, uh, from Massachusetts and we helped him draft that legislation which would change the exclusion so that, uh, it would eliminate the sexual deviance and psychopathic personality exclusions of gay people from the country. The, um, the next area I wanna talk to you about is the military. The, um, military has a, uh, a absolute policy that gay people cannot serve. And the only exception to this policy does not really afford the status of being gay. But someone who commits a homosexual sexual act if they renounce that act because he Christ was, I drunk last night. I didn't know what I was doing. You know, it was a mistake. It's never gonna happen again. Please let me stay in the military. They could stay in. Other than that, everybody else is out now, the progress that we've made in the last few years, at least that the discharge will be on your honorable conditions and will be entitled to full benefits. However, for somebody who's chosen to make a career of the service, this can still be pretty severe after you. Uh You've been in for so many years to lose all the benefits in in your particular chosen career and, and to have the government in fact, say to you, well, you're not good enough to fight and die for your country either we have a test case pending in Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals now. And all the, the man who was originally stationed out here at Monre, the language institute, that's Jim Jonn. He's a uh specialist in prep college. He had been in the service for nine years, three months before his discharge. He had been given a $12,000 reenlistment bonus. He had had accommodation after accommodation, after accommodation. They thought he was an excellent soldier until they found out he was gay. They picked him out the um the strategy of bringing the case in the District of Columbia was that by reputation, the District of Columbia's Circuit Court of Appeals is the most liberal in the country. And in addition, the, the, uh, the issue had been decided here in the Ninth Circuit some years ago by a case that we had brought and lost in ca, uh, that's known as Beller versus Middendorf. So there was no avenue available for redress here. And the, the strategy also would be that if we were able to get into the DC court, then that would resolve the issue for all soldiers because the issue of jurisdiction and venue revolved around where was the defendant located? It was our position. The Department of Defense and the headquarters of the Department of Navy were located in Washington DC and the government fought us tooth and nail on this. In fact, two thirds of their brief, they argued that the court didn't have jurisdiction and essentially for the, the merits of the case, all they did was say, well, another court out there in San Francisco decide this issue and so empty but said, well, we won half that case, we won the jurisdictional issue. Uh We lost on the merits. Now, we're in the court of appeals and our strategy, we found backfired on us because the odds maybe were 1000 to 1 of drawing three conservative judges in each room, three of the most conservative judges you could ever want to have. Um, one of them started asking questions about, did the right to privacy include the right to have sex with animals and you have to start off at this level. You can't be too optimistic about the result. One of the other judges who was a, um, a Reagan appointee to the bench was a former um professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School and a uh a student who did uh work for gay rights advocates as a volunteer last summer, had this a judge as a professor of constitutional law. And when this uh man came to the uh the issue of abortion rights, he said, I'm Catholic and I have nine Children and that's enough said about abortion. Let's move on. So as you can see, we're not too optimistic about in that case. Um There was a really great brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in that uh uh Nusra Brief or friend of the court brief. And what the ac lu did was to trace the rationale that the military uses for excluding gays. And they compared to the same rationale that the military used to segregate blacks from serfs to say, look, white men are never going to sleep in the same pas as black men and white soldiers never salute. So how can a black maintain control and command respect? And this is the same kind of thing they say about gays and lesbians in certain that it just isn't gonna work out. And what they're doing is trying to institutionalize somebody's prejudice rather than trying to deal with underlying problems. So, it's a, it's a very good and very detailed, uh, brief and very enlightening. I hope that the court takes some note of it. Um, the, the paradox to what's going on in the military is that if you're a civilian employee of the military, there's almost, it's also possible to get rid of you. Uh, regardless of what, what kind of activity you're involved in. Um, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently held that a person who is a convicted child molester still could be discharged from the Navy absent a showing that there was some connection with his job duties in the navy, what we call the nexus between his activity and his job requirements. So, in another area that we find the promise that, um, there are people who want to make a career out of the military, they make every effort to get rid of it as soon as they can. And those who want to get out somebody covers after they're in the service that they realize that their, uh, their sexual orientation is not, maybe what they thought it was when they come to the commanding officer to say I'm gay. These people flounder around in the system often for a year or more before they discharge. Even though the regulations are so mandatory and how we resolve that problem. I can't really say. But, um, it, it really sort of a schizophrenic kind of attitude where they, they just can't make up their mind what they want other problems that we, uh, we found now too is that the military, in some instances are trying to prosecute, uh, soldiers for asking for a discharge, saying that they enlisted fraudulently that they knew at the time that they enlisted that they were gay, that their enlistment therefore was fraudulent and they're trying to have them prosecuted. There's a case up on appeal on the 10th circuit court in Denver. It's been there for some time. So you should see a decision pretty soon. And that, uh, another thing that we find military is, is doing now, uh, is suing people who've gone through ROTC. And apparently they have some kind of program where they subsidize their educational benefits. And in the case that came before us last year, there was a person who went through medical school at University of the US Army. And then when he finished, he said, I'm sorry, I can't do my, uh, six year stint now because I realize I'm gay. The army said, well, I think we're gonna have to sue you for uh $60,000 to reimburse us for the cost of your education. We were willing to defend this man, but he didn't have the desire to go through several years of litigation. It takes a lot for, to, to, to go through that. And what he did instead was file the anchor in any case that, you know, if they picked up the pill or, or for those of you who are working, I guess, uh, we all picked up the pill in a sense, um, which leads me to the next thing that we've done is, uh, based on some data we've collected over the last couple of years, we can make a pretty good estimate that the, uh, the cost of separating gay people from the military is at least $20 million a year. That on average, the military separates about 1800 soldiers a year from the service because of homosexuality. And, uh, based on a recent rand corporation study, cost of training a soldier through basic training, the 1st 22 weeks is $100,000. So simple arithmetic. So that's $18 billion. And, and my experience is most of the people that are being discharged have been around for a lot more than 22 weeks. What's the situation with the conscription where somebody turns 19? Supposed to wear the post? Chocolate says I'm good. What, what is it? Well, you probably wouldn't necessarily tell the postmaster but you, you would still have to register and it wouldn't really become an issue until you were called up. And at that time, what happens is that you're given a questionnaire and ask you to list all of your childhood diseases and broken bones and, and there's a square somewhere that says, how are you looking to with homosexual tend? What happens? Then if you check the box and, and say you are so addicted, then, then you will be deferred. You will not be taken conducted in New York. You cannot be conducted in the, if you check, if you do not check the box, you, you could be inducted. However, if you fraudulently, if you know that you're gay and you don't check that box, you are subject to penalties of as much as five years in prison and $5000 if they could substitute, prove the case against you. Um Let's talk about employment discrimination a little bit. Something that's been in the news just recently was a B one finally passed both houses and sitting on Duke's desk waiting for signature. What most people don't know in this state is that all that bill does is codify a Supreme Court decision which already extends sexual orientation uh discrimination protection to all employers in the state. The only thing is that not all employees are covered and this was the case called gay law students uh for specific telephone and telegraph. And I say it doesn't cover all employees because it only covers those employees who are open or out on the job. Their employers got to know that they're gay because part of what the Supreme Court of California said in that case was that being out on the job is political activity. And that in this state, an employer may not discriminate against an employee based on political activity and political activity is much broader than partisan politics. It goes beyond the Democratic and Republican parties includes political causes, women's rights, labor, union rights in. So what the A B One does is detect those people who are not out on their job. And it also gives them an administrative remedy by going through the fair one housing administration rather in having the pro directly in court. Um Other uh employment work that we're doing at gay rights advocates. Uh One involves a suit against uh an amen is the Helms bill in Oklahoma. Helms bill is essentially similar to the bridge initiative that was up here in California a few years back while the bridges ini initiative was defeated here in California. It's lost in Oklahoma. And uh we filed a suit challenging that bill and we lost the district court level in Oklahoma. We have that case now up in the Court of appeals for the 10th circuit in Denver, we had oral arguments last September. So we're looking for a decision uh anytime in that case, we can make those things, the Helms bill evolved. Uh The main issue was uh first amendment freedom of expression. Uh That was the main cause of action. There was also we raised due process and equal protection arguments as well as right to privacy Mhm. In this, in this kind of litigation, I tell you that some of you who are law students and don't realize the rest of you and that we're often quite frankly flying by the seat of our pants. I mean, this is new and when we're in the courts and we're making new law, the, the gay rights litigation that's going on in this country is essentially taking place in the last 10 to 15 years. 10 years ago. Gr A didn't exist and the way more gay legal organizations around the country and most of the states still have sodomy laws in the books. And it's not uncommon to find all sorts of oppressive uh legislation on the books. So we don't have a lot to look toward in terms of precedence. We have to analogize a lot to the, the struggles that were won in the women's movement into the black movement and other first amendment uh types of cases, the, uh the privacy decisions that came out of the abortion litigation, contraceptive education. That's where we sort of draw. Sometimes we, we, we make analogies and stuff. We just make a new theories. You have, you have to go in there. See, we feel that gay rights out because we have a very aggressive litigation posture that if we don't go into court and file suit, then we've lost before we, we've even started. There is in a sense, nothing to lose by going into court because in the case of the Helms Bill situation, the Bills on the books and if we lose the Bill is still in the book. So what did we lose? But at least we go in there and fight. We have a chance of winning. And in addition, we feel there's some other benefits, there's educational benefits, there's consciousness raising, there's all the press, we, we engendered a lot of good press. People just cannot believe this. The situations I've been ascribing to you tonight about the military and immigration. These, these kind of things happening in America today in 1984 is just incredible. And so we feel there's a certain value to bringing lawsuits, win or lose. And it's making a statement generally too that, you know, you push this community around for just so long and now we're, you know, it's your game, but we can play it too and we're gonna be there and we're gonna fight and we're gonna win. But, you know, maybe we're not gonna win all time, but you're not gonna knock us out of the win because we're gonna be right back there fighting every time. That's what GR A gets it all about. I, I didn't really call the target. OK. You said you asked the person I see that g well, actually the law is, is so broad that it could exclude uh straight people as well because the language prohibits uh homosexual activity and homosexual conduct. Neither of which is defined as engaging in, in what we would call homosexual sexual conduct. Ok. It's the mere mention we're discussing homosexual rights could subject the teacher to a disciplinary hearing, impossible discharge from their employment. But the, the terms, uh, in the, in the law are so vague and so general that it's hard to, it's hard to tell exactly what could be brought within the curve of the law, but essentially it's expression it's talking about and discussing it anything about homosexuality in the case of they lost students first Pacific telephone t in, in regard to that case. Uh, and A B one, it sounded, it sounded what I heard was that, uh, dismissing employees on those grounds is prohibited. Uh, would, wouldn't A B one also apply to, uh, job applicants and to promotion processes. Uh, and it does specific, it does all, all type of employment related discrimination and promotions, fringe benefits, the hiring process. We need, we need the whole body witness. You see what, uh, my understanding is that of a coconut. I, I haven't taken a look at it in a while. I put you to spouses. Yeah, that, that's a whole other issue. And I think that's sort of the issue that in the eighties is the rights of gay couples. We're gonna be doing some and gain a couple of medication. We, we did one case already and, uh, we have two pending now which I'll, I'll go into a little bit. It's one that we're going to do in Columbia Maryland, which involves the, uh, American Automobile Association. And there they offer a discount to married couples but not to a, uh, a gay couple or a lesbian couple. And we're demanding that extend that same benefit to gay couples. The, um, the case arose in Columbia Maryland, which is situated in Howard County. Howard County has a very broad anti discs or it prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation as well as marital status. Really, this is sort of a marital status type discrimination as opposed to sexual orientation. However, gay people cannot be legally married anywhere in the country. So if it necessarily impacts on the gay community during happening. So, uh that's in the administrative process now and I think uh whoever loses that is probably going to appeal. So we're looking toward a long court battle out there. We have another case. Uh that's in a sort of free uh adversary position right now down in, in southern California in uh La Jolla where there's a gay couple that's been living together for six years, they have a relationship contract that go their relationship and they also uh are heading dispute with AAA this time with the automobile insurance and AAA offers apparently a 20% spousal discount, but this couple of course cannot qualify for that spousal discount. So, uh we just might have to zoo AAA in that issue as well. There are a number of areas where gay people because they cannot be long and married have uh fewer benefits and employment fringe benefits and taxation and so on pension, uh, plans. And, uh, we don't necessarily, as I said, we really expect to win all these cases, especially in the beginning. This is, we're looking at as, you know, at least a 10 year program. But, um, we're, we're going to start raising the consciousness of the insurance. There are already at least two insurance carriers that I'm aware of that offer, what they call domestic partnership or adult adult living companion. They have different euphemisms, um but they, they offer the plan already. And uh I think essentially these discounts are marketing gifts. I don't think there's any sound insurance reasons why they offer. And so it's, it's just gonna be a matter of breaking it down. And when a few insurance carriers start offering the program and they find out that it's profitable. I think we'll find many more start uh offering it as well. Some other employment cases we're involved in. One involves a high school guidance counselor in uh Mad River, Ohio. Uh Marjorie Roland came out on, on her job and, and uh she didn't have her contract renewed simply because of her sexual orientation. She wanted the district court level won an order for reinstatement and a $40,000 judgment for lost wages. And the school district appealed the case to the sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, we had oral arguments in that case last June. So I think we'd be seeing a decision on that one pretty soon now too. In Minnesota, there's a judge there by the name of Robert Crane, wh who's been on the bench for about, uh, excuse me, 19 years. And, uh, according to all his peers is a very able and competent judge, but, uh, he's being recommended for removal because he would not take a vow of celibacy. Written is his day his sexual orientation came to light when um he was arrested and charged with solicitation for prostitution, which he subsequently entered a plea to two misdemeanors uh soliciting uh male prostitutes. Now, what makes the case an interesting one of discrimination is that two years earlier, a straight judge in Minnesota was arrested and fled out to the same charges with female prostitutes. He was given a reprimand and a $250 fine. Crane Whitton has been ordered to pay a $46,000 fine and um recommended for removal from the bench and not the straight judge was not asked to take about celibacy. Now, the vowel cel celibacy comes from the fact that Minnesota has a sodomy statute. On the course, most people think that sodomy statutes prohibit gay people from having sex. Well, what most people don't understand is that that same statute in virtually every state that has a sodomy statute prohibits all sexual activity other than between a husband and wife and missionary position. So even straight people are subject to the same law in most states. It's a felony. And I'm telling you these laws are enforced in, in Nevada. A man was recently given 22 consecutive life terms for committing the abominable crime against nature. And in that case involved uh a a teenager. And so you could say, well, ok, this is minors. It's not the same. I can assure you a straight man would have never received the same sentence. And in addition, another case, I'm just aware of him about where there was a, a scorned lover who called the police because he walked in his lover having sex with another man and the police came out and they called the people what he say, flagrant elect in bed. This man was arrested, he was charged with sodomy. He was given a 20 year sentence first offense. So I tell you these laws they're in effect, they're enforced and even more than that, they're uh there's something that we are attacking around the the country because there are great psychological barriers to attaining gay rights in this country. It's sort of the bedrock discrimination. How can we give employment protection to, to criminals and city councils around debate extending uh civil rights orders to protect people and the base sexual orientation and how can we give civil rights protection to criminals? So this is the kind of thing that we have to get rid of in these, uh, sodomy laws. We have, uh, participated recently in a national conference of, uh, some other gay organizations and sponsored by the National, uh, American Civil Liberties Union in New York last fall where we are going to put together a strategy, attacking the remaining 25 sodomy statutes in this country. We're gonna go after them one by one and knock them off. We're gonna figure out what's the best form do we want to be in the state court? Do we want to be in the federal court? What is the correct time? And what is the correct mode for attacking these cases? It's gonna be in the criminal context. Is it going to be a civil challenge? Um, and we're gonna go after these statutes and we're gonna get rid of it. There was a, um, a significant victory in the sodomy challenge litigation last uh, year in the case of Baker versus Wade, which came out of, uh, the US district court in Dallas, Texas which ruled that, that sodom Statute of Texas was unconstitutional. The, um, Amarillo District uh attorney decided to appeal that decision even though the State Attorney General did not in that case is now before the US Court of Appeals Court, the Fifth Circuit New Orleans and oral arguments have been scheduled for the second week in March. In that case, I feel quite certain will also be appealed to the Supreme Court because of who wins. Now, what, uh, happened in that case, it's sort of a new twist was that at the court of appeals level, the district attorney said we've got to have a sodomy statute on the books because we needed to control A I DS. Well, at the time that, that, so the statute was passed, I assure you nobody had ever even heard of A I DS. And, uh Furthermore, the, uh, the state and the district attorney did not litigate the A I Ds issue at the trial level. And so it was our position at the court of appeals level that it's too late. Can I bring up a, a new issue for the first time at the court of appeals level? That same argument is being made to sodomy challenge and to the, uh, the law in Georgia. And there, the, uh, the case is on appeal before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The other case that's pending now that could have some impact, quite a considerable impact impact on. So the litigation in the future is a case which is presently before the US Supreme Court. This is the uplinger case which uh came out of the State of New York a couple of years ago by way of background, the uh New York Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in that state struck down the sodomy statute in New York. They said it was unconstitutional. The uh, state um applied for a writ assert to the US Supreme Court. They asked the US Supreme Court to review the decision. The US Supreme Court refused to grant the writ. So the, the court action became final, what we still have left on the books was a law which made it illegal to ask somebody to engage in deviate sexual behavior that they call loitering for the solicitation of deviate sexual behavior, which is defined as sovereign. So when a man named Robert Uplinger was arrested and charged under that statute, the uh end result, the court was, well, if it's perfectly lawful to engage in the act, why should it be illegal to ask somebody to engage in the act? And they struck down the solicitation statute. Also, this time, the District Attorney in Buffalo appealed the decision or asked for a register to the US Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court granted it and the speculation was that the reason they granted it was that they had changed their mind about the uno case and they really wanted to review the underlying issues of uh the sodomy uh legislation in New York. Uh And in fact, that was an argument that was made in the petition by the D A. Now, some events happened since that petition was filed and when the, the uh final uh brief was filed, they stayed in New York of the district attorney in Buffalo. He did not argue that the sodomy statute needed to be reconsidered. The, uh, and a and an interesting twist too was that the Attorney General of the State of New York Robert Abrams filed an, an nus brief supporting the, the decision of the New York Court of appeals that the law was unconstitutional. So you had in effect the State's Attorney General and a uh city D A on opposite sides of the same issue. Ngr A filed an amicus brief in the Supreme court arguing that the petition was improperly granted and that they had just throw the whole thing out after signing it. And what we're hoping is that they are not going to reach the underlying issues because for one thing, they're not proper before the court, it wasn't an issue in the lower court decision. And secondly, they were not adequately briefed because as I said, it was not an issue, oral arguments have already been presented. In that case, we're expecting a decision later this spring. Now, depending on what happens in that case, it could have a significant impact to you that medication for a good number of years to come. Another area of litigation that's going on is in the area of security clearances. Security clearances are necessary for people, many people who work for the government or work for private industry that do um contracts with the government, generally areas of energy and defense and what security clearance means is that the government says that you are ok to look at classified information and feel that you're not going to divulge this information. There's different levels of security clearance, gay people over the years had a great deal of problem giving security clearances. And what we found is that the government's policy on this is somewhat inconsistent. They do not have a, an interagency plan or a set of guidelines and criteria. Each agency decides on its own and there's an awful lot of discretion that can be exercised. What we found is a recent trend where in many agencies, a person can get a security clearance. Uh Some agencies so called intelligence agencies, I call them the police agencies. The FBI the CIA, the national security agency are, are hanging uh in their topic and they will not grant security clearances to anybody that they know is gay. Uh There's been some recent litigation against the CIA, there's one case that was filed more than a year ago in the District of Columbia District Court. Uh It's before Judge Barrington Parker and he's been sitting on uh motions for summary judgment in that case for more than a year. Now, there was a recent case filed in Los Angeles in the US assisted court down there involving John Green, who was an engineer with a company known as TRW. He's worked for TRWFV for 13 years and he's never had any problems in the, in the CIA. In fact, has never said that he uh leaked any information to dulse any information. But basically what they said was that he was gay and that he was subject to blackmail and he was gay and therefore like the false information. So that argument breaks down when the person says I'm not such as a black male, I'm open about my sexuality. My family knows my friends knows it's no big deal to me. I don't know why it's a big deal to you, but to the CIA it is still a big deal and they can't, uh they, they just cannot understand why there might be some kind of, or, or might not be some kind of problem here. So that case is pending. Uh US district Court, the government just yesterday filed its brief. Uh, they filed a motion to dismiss. They said the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. Um And based on sovereign immunity, they said the government did not consent to be sued in this case. And they also said that the judiciary would be infringing on the executive branch of government by getting involved in this matter. They said the CIA had absolute discretion to decide who gets the security clearance and who does not. So there will be the response of treatment following that on March the second, I'll talk only about two more issues. One is uh briefly some first amendment cases that we're involved in is we find that a number of gay uh, community newspapers. Like here in, uh, San Francisco, we have the Bay area border are being, uh, censored that a number of prisons around the country. Prisons who want to keep in touch with their gay communities are not being allowed to read these papers. So we're going to be involved in a suit probably as the group. They luck in the congressional Correctional Institute in, um, Kentucky. And, uh, maybe one here at the Lompoc prison and possibly run down in 10 as well. And then last thing I wanna talk about is the rights of gay students. Um I went to, well, I went to several undergraduate schools, but I graduated from Michigan State University, which is where I first got involved in a gay political causes. And um as a student, I brought a suit against the university for refusing to allow us to place a banner two official posts, shall we say of the university where you can announce events? And Michigan State University is on a main thoroughfare, 40,000 cars a day passed through his intersections. We wanted to put up in and said, hey, Pride Week and the administration wouldn't let us. So we, we filed an action against the university. We didn't win. But um, it was probably because we weren't adequately prepared because we found out from sort of some of our sources post administration that they had been warned by their lawyers not to do that again next year. Because they'd probably be in some pretty serious trouble. And so the next year we made an application to put up the band and, and come up without any problems. Now, this same school sitting in a city that has an anti discrimination ordinance, which I helped lobby for in 1971 last year, they allowed that gay students be kicked out of paternity is simply causing. So, even though you have an, uh, an anti discrimination ordinance, it's not going to be worth a whole lot and it's not force. So there are continuing problems going on. We found that there's a, you know, school mission called Andrews College which is trying to kick out two students because they allege they're gay. There's a, from a private college in the suburb of Chicago that once grant his bachelor's degree to a student, uh he's completed all of his course work. He said this person is gay and he doesn't need to criminal uh character requirements for our school. And if you can't handle this degree, we find um at the University of Arkansas and Fayetteville, the school has official uni uh grant, official university recognition to the student organization there, but they won't grant them any office space or uh any uh funding or, or any of the other benefits that might go along with official recognition. There's uh a case, two cases going on in Texas right now involving the rights of students get uh recognition at their campus. And, uh, my last big gay rights case before I came to the west coast involving the lawsuit against Georgetown University in Washington DC because they would not grant recognition to the undergraduate into the law school. Ok. Student organizations. So there are still a lot of, uh, lawsuits involving students as well as, as, uh, many other areas that are important. We can become complacent here in California. It doesn't have a sodomy statute anymore. We have a lot of protections and people go to a great section may be a lot more relaxed. They're used to hearing about seeing a gay community. It sort of this old hat. But in, in most parts of the country there's still a lot of problems and that's what national gay rights advocates is all about. Yes. Is if just taking one of any cases involving gay youth from their reps to their sexuality, they have not make sure. Does that seem to be something in California is here? Thanks very. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of, um, problems in that area. We have not taken on any cases involving that issue. I can't say we've been presented with any, what we do in determining what cases to take is, uh, we basically wait for people to come to us, which is, is not much of a problem. I get calls every day a day doesn't go by, they don't get at least one call. So I might complain about some kind of discrimination or adverse action. But that particular issue hasn't reached it yet. Top up in closer. So I just kept pointing out that the city has a law that says to was phenomenal. This is often used against ski couples. We haven't had any complaints in a long time about that kind of, of probably possible that is a, a way of sort of discriminating against uh gay people without being so forthright. And in saying that we're not gonna allow two gay people to live together, the, the history of that kind of legislation, I'm not so sure was necessarily anti gay, but it was intended to keep noise down to protect sort of family type environment. But, ok, some areas like that, it's very subtle that legislation in Virginia, in some states like Virginia, it's very blatant."}
