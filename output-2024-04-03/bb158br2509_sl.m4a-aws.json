{"language": "en-US", "transcript": "Right now, first of all, I'd like to get some background questions. Um, what year are you in? College? Senior? And where do you go to college? Stanford? And how many years have you been here? All four? What is your major field of study at Stanford? Oh, it's mathematics. And what do you plan to do after graduation? Um, computer programming. Uh, in this area in San Francisco? Where is your permanent address? When you're not living in Stan? It's in Fresno, California. And where did you go to high school at? In Fresno, mclean high school? Now, did you have much contact with people of different racial or ethnic backgrounds in the high school that you went to? No, there was very little. It was in the part of town where there weren't very many people from other racial groups. Now, if you can think back to time before you came to Stanford as a freshman, can you remember then what your feeling towards civil rights was? Well, I talk to there was that everybody should have the same rights that they didn't, but they should have people, you know, of all races and groups. Now, would you say that your opinion towards civil rights has changed since coming to Stanford. And if so how, well, I felt more strongly the in favor of civil rights. Well, especially since it's become, it's become more of an issue since I've been in college. Would you say that you have become more aware of civil rights? Yes, definitely. And what do you think would be the main sources of, um, awareness? Well, a lot of it, it, like I said, has become an issue and it, and on college campuses too, or at Stanford it sort of has become more of an issue. There's more, you can't really avoid the issue anymore at home. My parents were not exactly tolerant and they just, I mean, we just didn't discuss it very much at home but here there's more, more discussion of it. Well, has your exposure to the civil rights movement been mainly through the mass media or, um, through talking with friends in the dormitory or other people that perhaps have gone to work in the civil rights movement, mostly to the mass media and some discussion. But not too much. A lot of it has just been, yeah, I'm reading about it or hearing about it on the news. Now, do you discuss political or social or, or racial issues very much with your family? Not too much. It's not a subject that we bring up too much because we don't agree. Now, to what extent, um, are you influenced by the feelings of your parents. In other words, if, if you were strongly in favor of something that, uh, of making some decision that they were opposed to, uh, would their opposition keep you from making that decision? No, I consider their point of view and see if that had any bearing on, you know, I appreciate their standpoint, but I'd make my own decision regardless of theirs. Although I listen to what they had to say. Are you financially dependent on your parents? Somewhat? Not entirely. And do you think that this could be a factor in making you go along with your wishes even though you didn't agree with them? Well, not in any majors, I mean, not in any personal thing and things like going to college. Yes, but in a, any personal thing. No. Ok. Now you mentioned that your main exposure to the civil rights movement has been the mass media. Now, what would you say were the main goals of the civil rights movement as you see it? Well, to provide the same opportunities for everybody, regardless of the color of their skin or their, mostly that's the issue to give them all the rights that they may not have now, but sh should have as American citizens of what rights, voting rights, educational rights, um, employment opportunities are you in favor of these, uh, goals of the move as long as it's done, um, without making, forcing them into some place where they don't like saying, well, this man has to be hired because he's a negro regardless of whether he may not be as qualified as some white person. I mean, I think that they should be considered regardless of it. Not, not because they are a negro or because they are white but because they are qualified. I think there's sort of a tendency to say, well, now you have to give him a job because he's colored and you have to have so many colored people or something. Or do you think that, um, the movement is trying to take into consideration the fact that perhaps the Negro has been culturally deprived and maybe he isn't as qualified. I don't know, I don't think, I don't really think that anything that's a real apparent thing that they're working at, they're working. It seems to me like they're trying to put him in a position whether or not he may be as qualified to make him pretend that he's qualified whether or not he may be to say he should be qualified even if he may not be as well educated? Well, what do you think are the means employed by the civil rights movement? And are you in favor of these means? Uh, some of the means, I'm in favor of it. Some of them, I think of course, a part of it is, is keeping interest. I think one of their big things is, is keeping things stirred up. So people are always aware of this instead of just sort of letting it go along as it has for the last 10 years saying, well, we'll make this, we're all the same. But then letting people discriminate, I think that they're trying to keep it stirred up so that there's, there's active interest and people become interested. But I think some of these uh tactics like, well like the city and sometimes they're stirring up antagonism that um is really gonna not help the cause by, by really forcing the issue down, sort of down the throats of the southerners who aren't quite willing to take it. Uh What is your opinion toward uh the employment of uh civil disobedience? Do you feel that this is right or wrong as a method? I think that it, I don't really think that it's right and you mean like fins and that sort of thing, I think are, um are a little strong because I think they create a lot of antagonism that um is not necessarily good because it's those who are not particularly in favor of civil rights are not going to be contra by the fact that all these people are sort of sitting there in their way or, or doing something, you know, to, to create this antagonism. What kind of means do you think should be employed? Then? I'm not sure of. I mean, if I thought I knew the answer, I think that a lot of people would like to know it. I like to talk to you. Now, as you may have read a lot of college students from the north and well, from areas other than the south are going to Mississippi and Alabama and these different areas to work in the civil rights movement as uh freedom workers, voter registration. Do you know any people that have gone down south in this capacity? A couple? Um And if you think specifically these, these people, what, what is your opinion of these kind of persons that go to the south? Well, of course, you're very active. So people who are very interested and aware of what's going on all, although I think in some cases they may be sort of, well, I think they mean, well, but don't quite exactly know what they're going into. Sometimes it's sort of the attitude of they know what, what should be done, but don't always realize all the circumstances but are kind of going down there with this Fresh Acre. Look that, you know, a little bit naive maybe thinking that, that they know, you know, what's right and they're gonna go down there and so, you know, solve the problem of the world. But do you think that the students involved in the civil rights movement are contributing anything to the movement? And if so what I think in some cases they can. Yes. Yeah. Like when they're trying to educate the people and to help them, help the Negro people um improve themselves. I think they can make a valuable contrib contribution. But sometimes I think with such an influx that they also the, the Southerners will think uh or do think that, you know, all these kids are coming down there and telling us what to do. And I think that the, there's a little too much of it to where they're sort of, you know, it's the attitude of, well, the north is good to show the south how to run their life or their lives and it can CRE create dissension. Now, do you know people within your living group or on campus that are sympathetic towards civil rights but yet have not gone to the south? Yeah. Now, what would you think is the difference between someone who is sympathetic towards civil rights in favor of the means being employed and the goals of the civil rights movement and does not go south from the student who does go south. Well, part of it is, it takes, you have to be just a little, uh, well, not carefree but you have to be willing to sort of, uh, you have to be very adventuresome to sort of leave in the middle of school and run down there and to do something for a week or two, I think it takes, if somebody really looking for something, I think that those who go down there are sort of looking for something kind of exciting person. And in addition to wanting to help, I think they're sort of looking for something to, to get in on, you know, they want to get in on it. Whereas those who stay here, of course, someone would like to go and can't. But those who really do go are I in a way are sort of, you know, advent, it's kind of an adventure in some cases. Do you think the spirit of adventure characterizes the people that you mentioned before, that, you know, that have gone to some of them? Some of them, yes. And some of them maybe not so much. I mean, some of them are, they have to be in a way, sort of adventuresome because it is a long way to go, to go down there for a week or two and it's something new, sort of different. But I, there's a lot more to it than that. What do you think it involves besides the spirit of adventure? Well, I, a basic belief in what they're doing. I mean, it's sort of an idealistic thing that they think that they can to want to help. But it involves, I mean, they have to honestly want to do something because it's, it's a lot of trouble to go down there and it's, they're people who are really interested and concerned. How about people that really seem interested and concerned and speak in favor of civil rights. But yet they don't take that final step of going down south. Well, you know, perhaps some of them just aren't able to go in some cases or else they don't. Um, I really think that they could, there's anything that they personally could contribute by going down there. I think that the answers in some situations is probably the case that they feel that if they, you know, they don't have anything to constantly contribute personally by going down there. Now, if you had the opportunity to go to the South as a civil rights worker, would you go? I don't think so. No. And why would you not go? Well, first of all, my parents are just about tell me to forget to come back. I mean, I, which, I mean, I just hate to, I mean, if I really wanted to go, I'd go anyway, but there would, it would really cause a lot of trouble. But besides that, I, I don't think this, that there's that much that I, as one person could contribute down there that I wouldn't know what I was going into. And exactly, I don't think I know the whole situation and I'd like to go down and see the situation but I don't know if I would be qualified to, to really contribute anything myself. Well, what kind of qualities do you think that, um, SNCC and core and the NAACP and these different groups look for in a person? What kind of abilities to be performed in a civil rights worker. Well, it has to be somebody willing, willing, willing to, they make the sly. So, getting down there, I think they pay a lot of their own expenses and, uh, you know, give up a week or two at school, which a lot of people would like to do if they could. Really, it's, it is a sacrifice to go down and, and work and they ha, it has to be somebody who really believes in what they're doing and enough that they wouldn't get discouraged and yet, uh, I think, or at least I hope they're looking for people who aren't going to go down to cause trouble but are going down there sincerely to work and not just, you know, do a little bit of rabble, rousing. Now you speak in terms of students that go down for a week or two off school. How about students that go down for the entire summer to give their time? Would you ever consider this possibility? Well, not, I never, of course, have had a, a summer when I could just go down but for myself I don't, I don't think I do it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I would because it's a long time to go down. And, uh, like I said, I don't know if I'd have that much to contribute once I got down there. Now, have you ever been involved in any civil rights activities on a local level? No. Would you, uh, foresee the possibility in the future of becoming involved in civil rights on a local level? Oh, perhaps it would depend on what it was if it was something that I thought was valuable without being something like a sit in. I might, I'd consider it. Yes. But do you think that it's more valuable to, for these college students to, uh, go to the south where the civil rights problem has been, uh focused so strongly? Or do you think that it is better for them to work in their own hometowns on problems with civil rights? I think they might do better in their own hometowns where they know the situation a little better and are more known themselves and more apt to be accepted by the community than they would be in a, and I see a Southern community. I think that I think their contribution could be a little more positive at home. But do you think that the civil rights movement in the South has had the effect of making people more interested and more concerned uh with their own civil rights problems in their respective communities or do you think that it's had the effect, the opposite effect of having people shift their own blame to the people of the South? Well, I think sort of both things have happened depending on the area and depending on the people, there are those who seems to be kind of, are sweeping it under the rug and saying, well, they've got the problem and, you know, we really don't have much of a problem. But yet there's a lot, just a lot more interest in general in the problem and people all over even in, in the north beginning to realize that they have a few racial problems of their own. But I think, I think both things have happened depending on the area And the group there seems to be like in California, there seems to be a lot more, well, and say in San Francisco and Los Angeles there and even throughout the valley, there's been more interest involved in, like in Fresno and the schools a little more integration because all the sort of, there's one side of town and then there's the other side of town and there's one high school that's predominantly Negro and well Chinese and everything, but it's really a mixed and the rest of them are predominantly white and there's recently it's been a movement to mix them all around, but this sort of thing has just happened the last few, couple of years and I think more of that is gonna come up in a lot of areas. Do you think that you personally have any responsibility uh in the civil rights movement? And if so what, well, I think that I have a responsibility to, to do what I can but then that's, that's sort of vague to uh at least try personally to do. I mean, to be, say, sympathetic toward all groups and help them, you know, even in an impersonal contact and not to, uh, personally discriminate, I had to try. Of course, I don't know if I could go out and convince very many people, but I think just in my own personal affairs to do what I can. But as I don't know, I don't feel that I necessarily should go down and start telling other people what to do just because I would, if I thought there were anything valuable would come out of it. But I think that there might be a lot of resentment. Do you think that the progress of the civil rights movement would continue at the same pace that it is now, if there weren't any students going to the South, no, it wouldn't continue at the same pace. But, and if there weren't any, if it weren't being pushed right now and did things would stay pretty much like they, they have for the last 100 years, they advance more rapidly because everything's advancing more rapidly. But I think that had it been, the movement been maybe just not quite so strong. It might have been a little, well, there've been a little less bloodshed and a little less antagonism that they were, it had to be pushed. But I think it's been pushed a little bit too hard and a little bit too many people have been going down and saying, oh, we're gonna straighten things out for you. You don't know what you're doing down here, then I think that maybe half the students could have gone down and it would have worked out a little better. Do you think then minimizing the numbers would have minimized the amount of bloodshed and turmoil. Well, minimizing the whole, uh not just the numbers but the intensity. If it had been just a little less, a little less intense, the whole program, I think would have eliminated some of the, the real bloodshed. And would you say then that you are in favor of uh not going as forth as strongly as the movement presently is uh at the sacrifice of taking longer for these civil rights to be realized. Yes, I, I think so because I think that at the same time it's realizing the civil rights theory, there's a lot of, it's kind of messy. It would be anyway. But I think that if it may have taken a little bit longer but wouldn't have uh hurt so many people in the meanwhile, I don't know. I mean, that's the way it appears to me and that may not be true, but that's sort of the way I would look at it. Ok. Now, in switching back to your, uh your family background, uh what is your father's occupation? He's um, in the longer business I'm going into road construction. And is your mother employed No, she does. My father's bookkeeping is all. Now, uh, have your parents expressed any opinions on the civil rights movement since they've been reading about it in the newspapers and, uh, seeing things on television? Oh, yes. My mother thinks that they're a lot of troublemakers in the south and they had to leave things alone that it was like it was all right. And eventually everything would have turned out all right in 200 years, I guess. And my father really doesn't have much to say because I think that he probably doesn't agree with her, but it's easier to keep quiet that to start a fight. So, or have you ever had the opportunity to, uh, take question with, uh, your mother's pronouncements on the situation or do you assume your father's position? Well, I, uh, yeah, a time or two discussed the subject but, uh, we both have our own opinions. So we just, I mean, I found out that into her sema and, and just sort of left it at that. But do you find that you generally disagree on the goals of the movement or on the means of the movement or it's mostly on the means, the idea, the disagreement and the feeling most of my family, my mother's side of the family because my father's side of the family. I don't never see. But their feeling is mostly that it's being pushed too hard. Of course, they're also cold water conservatives. So, I mean, they're, they're just very conservative on the, the whole thing and they think that it's, it's being pushed and that you just can't do it that way that you just kinda let it gradually happen over several 100 years, I guess. Or if someone were just to come up and ask you point blank, what is your opinion of the civil rights movement? Uh, are you in favor of it or not in favor of it? How would you answer? I would say that I was in favor of it. Yeah. And in terms of the means of the movement generally, I agree with it. I mean, like I said, there, I have disagreements with it but on a whole, I think it's, it's aimed in the right direction. And do you have any opinions or, uh, pictures of the kind of people that are involved in the civil rights movement that I impress you either favorably or, or disfavor? Well, now I have a several different impressions. I mean, I think that, well, I'm sure that there are people who are, most of the people are very sincerely believe in it and are very working hard to do what they think is best. I think there are unfortunately those who are sort of in it to see what, you know, for a little bit of excitement or, or because it's the thing to do or to cause a little trouble or something. But I think on the whole, it's, it's those people who really mean well, and who are trying to do it as best they can. Well, in terms of values and a commitment and such toward the situation, how would you think that these people, specifically, the ones, you know, would have gone south would differ from you? Well, among other things that they probably just feel a little more personally involved in the situation and have to go down there. I mean, it is sort of a long ways from here and I tend to be a little apathetic and, uh, I think that they're just more vitally interested in it, enough to really run down there and do something. What risk? Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. I forgot. I'm sorry for interrupting you. Uh, what risks do you think would be involved in going to the center? Well, now the risk would it? Well, there have been a few people disappeared. Although I think that's, I mean, I think that's a sort of one or two instances. I don't think that I don't really think that I would expect to be shot when I was down there. But, um, there is, of course a risk of being thrown in jail, the risk of running into a lot of antagonism and a lot of ill feeling, but I don't maybe getting a rock thrown at you or something, but I don't think, I don't think there's any huge risk as far as, um, you know, as far as personal injury or anything, I don't, the risk, I don't think is a prison is too great. Do you think the possibility of, of physical violence to your person, of discomfort in terms of living conditions or possibly being arrested of the erratic schedule that a civil rights worker would have to keep, do you think that, uh, these factors would, um, be a, any sort of a strong influence toward, I'm making you decide not to go? Well, I'd consider them if I, if I thought that they were fans, I think that, I mean, there would be hardships I, you know, might have to sleep in the car or something. But I think that that wouldn't, that wouldn't be the main thing I'd consider what would be, whether or not I could really, it would really be worth my while to go down there. I mean, if I thought I was gonna get shot at, I really don't think I'd go because I don't particularly want to dodge bullets, but I don't think that's the case. Yeah, I think the consideration would be more whether or not I could do something on once I got there. But you just, uh, stated that one of your main considerations would be whether or not it would be worth your while to go. Now, what do you think you personally could, uh, derive from the situation? Well, that I think that I could contribute something, it would be worth something that I could do here would be worth leaving what I'm doing here to go down if I thought I could contribute more there. And in terms of, you know, the time I lose here, if I thought I could contribute something valuable enough in relation to, to what I'd lose by, go by spending some time down there. What would you lose by spending time down there? Well, I'd lose either. Well, actually I'd lose money if I were working or time in school or plus all the trouble of, of go getting there and anything that would, I mean, it is a long ways away and just, you know, the whole trouble of getting ready and going and, and leaving whatever I might be doing here. I don't know, it did, would depend on what I was doing at the time. What I'd miss. Now, is there any statement that you'd like to make concerning civil rights that I have not asked you about? Not that I can think of. All right. Well, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate it."}
