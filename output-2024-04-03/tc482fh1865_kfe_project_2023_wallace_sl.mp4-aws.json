{"language": "en-US", "transcript": "Red algae which is categorized under the phylum rotta is distributed across all oceans. Its color comes from its accessory photosynthetic pigments, phyo Ein phyo and Aloin phyo Ein in particular reflects red light and absorbs blue light which penetrates deeper than any other light wave. And that's why reds are usually found deeper than any other algae, including browns and greens. They're incredibly important to marine ecosystems and come in many varieties. This includes branching leafy bushy lacy, crustose, coralline and articulated Coraline coral lines are particularly known as reef builders because they secrete carbonate around themselves, which is a hard protective layer in much the same way that corals do light requirements vary between different Rhys as their levels of photosynthetic pigments vary and thus, as their complex life cycles progress, they mainly compete for light and space to settle and grow. So for this project, I wanted to explore the question of whether the hold fast of macrocystis pyra, which is a canopy algae had an impact on the presence of different types of red algae using the diamonds, video surveys. I categorized them into reds, crustose coral lines and articulated coral lines. The study area was Hopkins Marine Life Refuge where each team had a marked starting point along a cable located in the kelp bed offshore. That cable was divided into four sites at 0 5100 and 100 and 50 m respectively. Each site had a starting and ending depth that was noted. Teams were assigned a came rig consisting of a GoPro two lights and a PV C pipe bar which was a meter long as well as a 30 m transect which was laid out. And that's where the vig videos were taken from there. I used each group's videos to estimate out cover for each video. I noted how many hold fast were present and took a screen grab each time using a 10 by 10 grid with 100 squares. I estimated the average percent cover of reds cresto coral lines and articulated coral lines. I then used a random number generator with the total video time to select random points along the transact to estimate album cover when the Hold Fasts were not present. So after finding all the averages, the general patterns I saw were that red algae were more common along the shallower depths of the cable at around 0 m with their presence being more prominent when hold vests were absent for Cristo's coralline algae. The opposite was true. They were more common at the deeper points of the cable at 100 and 50 m, but they were still more common when the whole fast was absent and lastly for the articulated coralline algae. Uh it was a pretty consistent trend of having them be more present when the hold fast was present and it was consistent along the entirety of the cable. Now, I do believe more data definitely needs to be collected in order to make any definitive conclusions about whether hold fast presence has an impact on red algae growth. I do think being able to visualize the patterns observed through the diamond videos was a huge success despite some limitations, including things like over exposure from lights, blurry videos and difficulty. I ding in some cases, we now know it's totally possible to use these video surveys to look at algae cover. Algae is already a very understudied field. And having that knowledge along with the ability to scuba dive makes it pretty rare for folks to be able to survey them in situ dimes videos in turn can be a great resource for I ding estimating cover. And more."}
