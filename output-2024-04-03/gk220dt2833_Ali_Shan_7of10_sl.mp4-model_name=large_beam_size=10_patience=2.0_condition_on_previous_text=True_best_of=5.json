{"text": "okay so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions that'll help me better understand the journey so you were talking about when the gunman took you with him do you remember what that journey was like and what you saw along the way oh not really much because all we were traveling and I was always wondering what's going to happen to me and where he's taking me he didn't explain to me anything so we used to at night we used to spend in a village along the way and where we get food and everything and rested and then start another day so that's how I remember going through the fields you know that was so you walked through fields all day yeah and then um what about eating during the day where did you eat oh we pick up the food from the village along the way so we eat we rested during the day in hot weather under the trees or somewhere so we ate whatever we got there he got I didn't know but he was getting food from somewhere you know from the village along the way so that's where we spent the day and what were the people like in the villages along the way oh they were I don't know what story he was telling them so I didn't know much about it but they were okay were there other children that you saw no but were there other children that you saw no and then when you went into your new family um how was that how many family members did they have there were two children, two boys, husband & wife, and husband's older brother they were all together about five their older son was about 16 15 16 only the younger one was about my age what was a typical day like um with that family uh I've used to travel much more often than before um but when you got off yourolv prod Ric 이것 to go out in the village, in the farm, help there wherever I could. Yes, every day I used to go to the farm, yeah. So whatever I could do, I built away. Did their children also go to the farm? Yes. And what about school? No school. None of you guys went to school? Not really, no. Did anyone come to teach at home? No. What are the memories that you have from living in that family? Anything that really sticks out to you? The only thing that sticks out to me is that I was treated well. I was given the same food that they were eating. But still I was not comfortable because I knew that I was not one of them and I had my family which I don't have anymore. So I just resolved to my life whatever was there available to me. So that was it. Very frustrating, very I was so quiet. I was not having any fun anywhere. I was just kept to myself. Did you play with any other children? No. I would come home and stay home because mostly I was scared because I was so fresh what happened to me and my family. So not much I could do. That's why I came back to my family. Did they know your real name at any point? Yes they did. They didn't know, they knew my name, they knew my village where I come from and all that. How did they know all that? The guy told them. How did the guy know your name? because he asked me when he took with me along the way. He asked me my name and my family and all sort of things and my father who I was and what happened to him and all that. I told him everything. Do you remember the name of the village you grew up in? Yeah, I remember the village. I grew up there. I grew up in my family. Who was your father? Oh, my Okinawa. Yeah, my father was born in Okinawa. When did he came here? I was in Okinawa and my father came with me. What happened to you? do you remember the name or did you in any way hear the name of the person who took you and so when they came to find you uh did you have any idea what was going on yeah i know because what happened was this there was some incident when they military went to recover girls and boy they used to hide them so they couldn't find them so and they didn't have enough time to look around so they came first time they came during the day and uh i was not there i was in the fields so they told them he's not here so they went back they didn't ask any question where he was so then the guy who told them who i was and they went to him they said that we couldn't find the that boy there and because my cousin was my father's cousin were involved he wanted to find me then about my me living there so um he uh he said go at night i will be there at that time at night so they came and i had about 9 30 10 o'clock so one person knocked the door and they didn't know who was as soon as the door opened there was boot sounds of boots and a lot of people were talking each other so then all of a sudden one of them said is the muslim boy so i was upstairs with the their one of their son sleeping upstairs so they came upstairs and they asked who's the muslim boy so i stood up then they brought me downstairs and i was crying i was nowhere what was going on so i was so scared i didn't want to go with him so then one of the soldier told my uncle's cousin who was there they told him to take it me on one side and tell tell me all my background my family so then i will be more calm and go with them so he took me on one side and told me about my father's name and my uncle's names and about the village and all that so then i was kind of satisfied that he's he knows the family so he'll be okay to go with so i went with him to the to ludhiana there because i had a long hair at that time and i had simple clothes so he went took me to the barber cut my hair and bought new clothes for me so then i would live there for two weeks after then i was transferred to pakistan on the hall here in the fuji camp and where did you live in ludhiana oh i don't remember it was where the soldiers were living they had a one area reserved for the all the refugees who they recovered they used to stay there until the bus was ready bus load was ready to transfer to pakistan and you know about the first time when they came to look for you who told you that story how did you find out about because when i came home in the evening at that time the family talked about it oh and what did you think i thought it was really funny because it was quite a long fait you think no I didn't know as I said you know I was too young to know who they were and what they were looking why they looking for me and because I went to that tragedy what happened so I was scared anyway I was not sure where somebody would take me and who they are and where they coming from why they're looking for me and how did you find out that it was one of the boys from that family who had tipped off is that after that my father's cousin he told me after that when he recovered me and he told me that's where he found me that that boy came and told him where I was and who I was so can you describe the journey to the refugee camp who were the people that were with you? When they put us on the bus I didn't know anybody in the bus I didn't know anybody out anywhere and my father's cousin couldn't come with us because he was in the military so you got to stay there so he wrote a letter to my his cousin my uncle that I was found and I will be in the refugee camp but because of the mail so slow they couldn't get it for two months the letter so by the time they got a letter in the meantime my mother's brother came and picked me up from there and took me with him to his house in kasur can you describe the refugee camp uh it was a huge it was used to be jail before with the high walls and a big huge courtyard and they emptied the jail and made a refugee camp and where was this what city in lahore and on jail road it's used to call jail road at that time that road so that's that's where it was so where did you sleep and what did you eat i would sleep on the floor and there was food provided both times morning and evening and uh that's where it was in the refugee camp uh i myself was looking in the future camp that i could find some family members i could find anybody so i resolved myself well i don't know what's going to happen now i was just staying there every day did you talk to anyone no nobody talked to me i didn't talk to anybody as well what were the people like from your observation oh everybody was terribly frightened and confused because they were just the only people over there they have lost their family contact and everything they didn't know where their families were all the girls and boys or young girls or older girls whoever they were so nobody knew what to do what not to do and they were waiting for their relatives to come there and find them that was the only way there was no contact whatsoever and nobody knew who survived who didn't and i didn't know myself that uh how many my cousin uncles or anybody cousins who survived who didn't I didn't know at that time what were the general ages of the people you think the youngest one were around my age five six year old seven year old eight year old and then they were girls about 15 16 18 year old and some older women too and what was the general mood about how are people communicating with each other no really because everybody was so traumatized everybody was thinking about their own family own that somebody would come and pick them up they did tell sort of tragic story to each other what happened at the time they moved they were taken from their homes and families but that was out there to it otherwise nobody knew do you remember any stories no I don't and do you remember the day that you were found yeah about your relatives yeah my uncle came and what happened what they used to do was that they deserve whenever refugee came they're just wrong on the names and family names and where they come from so", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.58, "text": " okay so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions that'll help me
