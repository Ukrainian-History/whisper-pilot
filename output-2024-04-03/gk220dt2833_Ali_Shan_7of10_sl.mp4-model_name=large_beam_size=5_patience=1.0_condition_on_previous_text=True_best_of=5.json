{"text": "okay so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions that'll help me better understand the journey so you were talking about when the gunman took you with him do you remember what that journey was like and what you saw along the way oh not really much because all we were traveling and I was always wondering what's going to happen to me and where he's taking me he didn't explain to me anything so we used to at night we used to spend in a village along the way and where we get food and everything and rested and then start another day so that's all I remember going through the fields you know see walk through fields all day yeah and then what about eating during the day where did you eat oh we pick up the food from the village along the way so he was arrested during the day in hot weather under the trees or somewhere so we ate whatever we got there he got I didn't know but he was getting food from somewhere you know from the village along the way so that way we spent the day and what were the people like in the villages along the way oh they were I don't know what story he was telling them so I didn't know much about it but they were okay were there other children that you saw no know mom and then when you went into your new family how was that how many family members did they have there were two children two boys husband wife and husband's older brother they were all together about five of them yeah their older son was about 16 15 16. the younger one was about my age yeah what was the typical day like um with that family to go out in the village, in the farm, help there where I could. Yes, every day I used to go to the farm, yeah. So whatever I could do, I built away. Did their children also go to the farm? Yes. And what about school? No school. None of you guys went to school? Not really, no. Did anyone come to teach at home? No. What are the memories that you have from living in that family? Anything that really sticks out to you? The only thing that sticks out to me is that I was treated well. I was given the same food that they were eating. But still I was not comfortable because I knew that I was not one of them and I had my family which I don't have anymore. So I just resolved to my life whatever was there available to me. So that was it. Very frustrating, very frustrating. I was so quiet. I was not having any fun anywhere. I was just kept to myself. Did you play with any other children? No. I would come home and stay home because mostly I was scared. Because I was so fresh, what happened to me and my family. So not much I could do. And did they know your real name at any point? Yes they did, yes. They didn't know my name, they knew my village where I came from and all that, Yes. How did they know all that? The guy told them. How did the guy know your name? Because he asked me. And when you ask me along the way, he asked me my name and my family all sort of thing, you know. And my father, who I was what happened to him and all that. Yeah I told him everything. Do you remember the name, or did you in any way hear the name of the person who took you? No, no one. And so when they came to find you, did you have any idea what was going on? Yeah, no, because what happened was this. There was some incident when the military went to recover girls and boys. They used to hide them so they couldn't find them. And they didn't have enough time to look around. And so the first time they came during the day, and I was not there. I was in the fields. So they told them he's not here. So they went back. They didn't ask any question where he was. So then the guy who told them who I was, and they went to him. They said that we couldn't find the boy there. And because my father's cousin was involved, he wanted to find me. So he went to the person who informed them. About me living there. So he said, go at night. I will be there at that time, at night. So they came, and I had about 9, 30, 10 o'clock. So one person knocked the door, and they didn't know who it was. As soon as the door opened, there was a boot, sounds of boots, and a lot of people were talking to each other. So then all of a sudden, one of them said, where is he? Where is the Muslim boy? So I was upstairs with one of their sons, sleeping upstairs. So they came upstairs, and they asked, who is the Muslim boy? So I stood up. Then they brought me downstairs, and I was crying. I didn't know what was going on. So I was so scared, I didn't want to go with him. So then one of the soldiers told my uncle's cousin, who was there, they told him to take me on one side and tell me all my background, my family, so then I will be more calm and go with them. So he took me on one side and told me about my father's name and my uncle's name and about the village and all that. So then I was kind of satisfied that he knows the family, so he'll be okay to go with. So I went with him to Ludhiana. There, because I had long hair at that time, and I had simple clothes, so he went and took me to the barber, cut my hair, and bought new clothes for me. So then I lived there for two weeks. Then I was transferred to Pakistan, Lahore, in a refugee camp. And where did you live in Ludhiana? I don't remember. I remember it was there. It was where the soldiers were living. They had one area reserved for all the refugees who they recovered. They used to stay there until the bus load was ready to transfer to Pakistan. And you know about the first time when they came to look for you? Who told you that story? How did you find out about that? Because when I came home in the evening, at that time the family talked about it. Oh, and what did you think? And you heard them talking about it? No, I didn't know. As I said, you know, I was too young to know who they were and why they were looking for me. And because I went to that tragedy, what happened, so I was scared anyway. I was not sure where somebody would take me and who they are and where they're coming from, why they're looking for me. Nothing at all. And how did you find out that it was one of the boys from that family who had tipped off? After that, my father's cousin, he told me after that, when he recovered me, and he told me that's where he found me. That boy came and told them where I was and who I was and all that. So can you describe the journey to the refugee camp? Who were the people that were with you? How did you get there? I... When they put us on the bus, I didn't know anybody in the bus. I didn't know anybody out anywhere. And my father's cousin couldn't come with us because he was in the military. So he got to stay there. So he wrote a letter to his cousin, my uncle, that I was found and I will be in the refugee camp. But because of the mail, so slow, they couldn't get it for two months, the letter. So by the time they got the letter, in the meantime, my mother's brother came and picked me up from there and took me with him to his house in Kassur. Can you describe the refugee camp? It was a huge, it was used to be jail before with the high walls and big, huge courtyard and they emptied the jail and made it a refugee camp. And where was this? What city? In Lahore on Jail Road. It was used to be called Jail Road at that time. That road. So that's where it was. So where did you sleep and what did you eat? We sleep on the floor. And there was food provided both times, morning and evening. And that's where it was, in the refugee camp. I myself was looking in the refugee camp. That I could find some family members. I couldn't find anybody. So I resolved myself. I don't know what's going to happen now. I was just staying there every day. Did you talk to anyone? No. Nobody talked to me. I didn't talk to anybody as well. What were the people like from your observation? Oh, everybody was terribly frightened and confused. Because all the people over there, they have lost their family contact and everything. They didn't know where their families were. All the girls didn't know. Boys or young girls or older girls, whoever they were. So nobody knew what to do, what not to do. And they were waiting for their relatives to come there and find them. That was the only way. There was no contact whatsoever. And nobody knew who survived, who didn't. And I didn't know myself that how many family members or my cousins, uncles or anybody, cousins who survived or who didn't. I didn't know at that time. What were the general ages of the people you think? Youngest one were around my age, 5, 6 year old, 7 year old, 8 year old. And then there were girls about 15, 16, 18 year old. And some older women too. And what was the general mood about, how were people communicating with each other? Not really. Because everybody was so traumatized. Everybody was thinking about their own family. That somebody would come and pick them up. They did tell a sort of tragic story to each other. What happened. The time they moved. They were taken from their homes and families. But that was the only way. Otherwise, nobody knew. Do you remember any stories? No, I don't know. And do you remember the day that you were found by your relatives? Yeah, my uncle came. And what happened, what they used to do was that they registered whenever a refugee came. They registered on the names and family names and where they come from. And...
