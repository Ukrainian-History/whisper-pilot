{"text": "Red algae, which is categorized under the phylum Rhodophyta, is distributed across all oceans. Its color comes from its accessory photosynthetic pigments, phychoetherin, phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin. Phychoetherin in particular reflects red light and absorbs blue light, which penetrates deeper than any other light wave, and that's why reds are usually found deeper than any other algae, including browns and greens. They're incredibly important to marine ecosystems and come in many varieties. This includes branching, leafy, bushy, lacy, crostus coralline, and articulated coralline. Corallines are particularly known as reef builders because they secrete carbonate around themselves, which is a hard protective layer, in much the same way that corals do. Light requirements vary between different rhodophytes as their levels of photosynthetic pigments vary, and thus as their complex life cycles progress, they mainly compete for light and space to settle and grow. So for this project, I wanted to explore the question of whether the holdfast of Macrocystis pyrophorae, which is a canopy algae, had an impact on the presence of different types of red algae using the DIMES video surveys. I categorized them into reds, crustose corallines, and articulated corallines. The study area was Hopkins Marine Life Refuge, where each team had a marked starting point along a cable located in the kelp bed offshore. That cable was divided into four sites at 0, 50, 100, and 150 meters, respectively. Each site had a starting and ending depth that was noted. Teams were assigned a camera rig consisting of a GoPro, two lights, and a PVC pipe bar, which was a meter long, as well as a 30-meter transect, which was laid out, and that's where the benthic videos were taken. From there, I used each group's videos to estimate elbow cover. For each video, I noted how many holdfasts were present and took a screen grab each time. Using a 10x10 grid with 100 squares, I estimated the average percent cover of reds, crustacean corallines, and articulated corallines. I then used a random number generator with the total video time to select random points along the transect to estimate algal cover when the holdfasts were not present. So after finding all the averages, the general patterns I saw were that red algae were more common along the shallower depths of the cable at around zero meters, with their presence being more prominent when holdfasts were absent. For Christos coralline algae, the opposite was true. They were more common at the deeper points of the cable at 150 meters, but they were still more common when the holdfast was absent. And lastly, for the articulated coralline algae, it was a consistent trend of having them be more present when the holdfast was present, and it was consistent along the entirety of the cable. Now while I do believe more data definitely needs to be collected in order to make any definitive conclusions about whether holdfast presence has an impact on rodology growth, I do think being able to visualize the patterns observed through the DIMES videos was a huge success. Despite some limitations, including things like overexposure from lights, blurry videos, and difficulty IDing in some cases, we now know it's totally possible to use these video surveys to look at algae cover. Algae is already a very understudied field, and having that knowledge along with the ability to scuba dive makes it pretty rare for folks to be able to survey them in situ. DIME's videos in turn can be a great resource for IDing, estimating cover, and more.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 16.64, "text": " Red algae, which is categorized under the phylum Rhodophyta, is distributed across all oceans.", "tokens": [50365, 4477, 32658, 11, 597, 307, 19250, 1602, 833, 264, 903, 27512, 36951, 29087, 1328, 11, 307, 12631, 2108, 439, 25004, 13, 51197], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1433142344156901, "compression_ratio": 1.5257142857142858, "no_speech_prob": 0.02332412637770176}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 17.1, "end": 21.54, "text": " Its color comes from its accessory photosynthetic pigments, phychoetherin,", "tokens": [51220, 6953, 2017, 1487, 490, 1080, 30617, 5787, 18656, 3532, 8120, 1117, 11, 903, 88, 5738, 1666, 259, 11, 51442], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.1433142344156901, "compression_ratio": 1.5257142857142858, "no_speech_prob": 0.02332412637770176}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 21.740000000000002, "end": 27.3, "text": " phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin.
