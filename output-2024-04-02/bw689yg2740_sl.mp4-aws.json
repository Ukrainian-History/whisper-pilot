{"language": "en-US", "transcript": "The person who's gonna say the blessing is Benny Shino, who is the director of our American Indian program here at Stanford. And um he's Hamus. I'm gonna say the opening prayer in my own mind vision. So also uh as I say the prayer and I say your own prayers. Well, so he would and the government from German. So I said to him that I should or not later not to be and to the world way over more of that tool as a way of human me to prepare that take a number. I agree, I find and I think it they might be in them. They might be great. What in the world a month? You know, they qualified and once more play a little work in the OK, please issue the way of the thank you reship for policy, man. OK. Um I guess we're gonna go ahead and get started so everyone can be seated and um find a seat. Yeah. Yeah, we're trying to go a lot. OK? Um Just to um we want to welcome you to Stanford University, everyone who's come from other universities. Um My name is Ray Ramirez. I'm um a part of uh SNAGS which is Stanford Native Ame American graduate um group. And uh we helped put this conference together or this forum together. Um We just want to say that this is, this is supposed to be like a conversation. Um The way it's gonna work is each, each person who's going to talk about, their work is going to come and sit at, at this point in the table mainly because we are uh videotaping the event. Um And we'll present for about 10 minutes and then the rest of the time will be for uh basically a conversation just to talk about, you know, the issues that were brought up in the presentation. Um Maybe some similar experiences we've had doing, doing research, um just, you know, very informal, you know, we want people to feel comfortable and um just, just really enjoy the day. Um We're gonna start out with uh Benny Shen who's gonna come up and say a few words. And then after uh Benny Shen will be um Jim Larrimore who's um used to be the director of our American Union Program office, which is now the acting dean of students here at the university. Good night. Um I just like to welcome all of you to the second annual research forum. Um As Ria mentioned, I'm the assistant Dean of Students and also Director of our American Indian Program. Um I'm new to Stanford. I've been here for going on my seventh month. But uh it's, it's, it's been really good when Gil mentioned this uh forum last year, they had their, their first annual. Uh It really got me excited because it was one of the things that we really wanted to do is, you know, what are some of our students doing in terms of scholarship and work that affect native communities? And so we talked about it and we began to brainstorm it. We did it last year. It was very informal and it would say it was a wonderful experience. We wanted to keep it that way. We wanted it to be a conversation and discussion. Um So that uh you could really get a lot out of it. And uh so we, we planned it and uh Ria has been very, both Ria and gay have been very instrumental in making this happen again. So I'd just like to uh welcome all of you on behalf of our American Indian and Alaska Native program at Stanford. So hope you enjoy your day. Sure, I guess um this is kind of an unusual thing for me because as Rie mentioned, I've been kind of changing um my professional identities around Stanford for the last year or so and I have made the a a series of shifts and the shifts that have come have been after serving for nine years as the director for the American Indian program, uh making a break and um starting full time as a doctoral student over in the school of education in Higher Ed and administration policy analysis last fall. And after six months of being a student, uh taking a leave and stepping in as the acting dina students here. And after my first week on the job, which was just this past week, I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to going back to being a student again in September and, uh, and just getting much more in touch with um kind of classroom life with, uh with research and with a chance uh chance to really focus on, on thinking hard about things on uh kind of how things are, how they got that way and, and maybe how they could be. And, uh, and so this is uh for me, uh a little bit of a homecoming and uh and being back involved with uh with the community, um after trying to uh maintain a little bit of, of distance to help my, my own transition this year. And, uh, and so it's a real kind of honor and a, and a pleasure to be among all the folks that are here this morning. Um I spoke yesterday afternoon with uh Condoleezza Rice, our, our university provost. And I was in that she informed me that she had a, a scheduling conflict that had come up with a gathering up in San Francisco. And, uh, and so Connie asked me if I would extend a welcome on behalf of the university to folks that have, have traveled, uh from other, uh, schools, other places here in, in California and elsewhere to be with us today. And, uh, and so I hope that, um, and it looks from looking out behind the camera and out the window that, uh, that this may be the kind of Stanford weather and the kind of northern California weather that we're accustomed to here. And uh so I hope that the the surroundings will be pleasant and uh and supportive of the kind of thinking and, and talking that you all want to try and do today. Um As uh as Benny was, was doing his um opening prayer for this, this gathering, uh this morning, it reminded me of um how important it is that as people gather uh that we pray and as we pray that we pray for wisdom among other things and that the wisdom that, that we seek is in order to make life better, uh for those around us to make life better for those, those among us and also to try and make life better for those yet to come. And uh and I, I think that for me represents the spirit of, of what the American Indian Alaskan native research is about, uh you know, we've, we've been um researchers and scholars uh for thousands of years and it may not have been uh things that have been written down and recorded in the forms that universities are used to. But I, I think you can find no better example of a scholarship and humane scholarship than the kind of knowledge that exists within our communities. The kind of knowledge that people are about uh working with and creating and, and passing on. Uh And uh and so I, I want to say, you know, on, on um again, on behalf of um of myself and, and for the university, uh that this is an important gathering and that this marks, I think a real turning point for the way that we can support each other in the way that we can support uh students and, and support faculty tenured and otherwise in the pursuits and the kinds of, of uh pressures that they face in their lives as um as people go through the day. Um uh what I would, would like to uh to suggest or offer as a way of thinking about this is that, that people, um you know, realize that this is a time. So if you may have met each other, you may have come with friends from other campuses. But this is a real opportunity to get to know people that uh that you may come in contact with uh on an, on an infrequent basis. People that you may not see until maybe during pa season, you'll see folks around uh different places, faces that you might recognize in, in different parts of the country at, at different meetings or community gatherings. And uh and so I hope that during the day you'll, you'll take the opportunity to get to know some folks that, that may not be from where you're from and uh and get a chance to help establish a, a tighter uh community based for all of us that way. Um I would also like to suggest that maybe there, there are a few different ways to think about uh how this gathering is, is situated and what this represents because I, I think uh it's important to, to be able to look at, at this assembly of people and to look back at how this connects with our past and to think about how this connects you with previous generations within your own tribe, within your own communities, within the campus communities that you're a part of, within the whole idea of, of knowledge and what that represents for our communities. And so as, as you're here and as, as you're hopefully um going through some of the excitement about thinking about uh things that people are going to present, you'll be able to feel some connection with those that have been here before you. Uh I also hope that you'll feel a sense of that connection with the people that are here with you today and that uh as you listen to people and engage in some discussions with each other that you'll be uh you know, able to do that in a, in a friendly, uh, cooper, but even challenging way with each other and to really help, push each other to the best and, and the, the hardest thinking that you can do about things and, uh, and finally, but, um, it kind of brings me back to my, my old life, uh, being I think more involved, uh, on a, on a regular basis with the community here. Uh, I, I really hope that you'll carry some things away from this weekend that are gonna help you within your own communities and especially that are going to help you reach out to one more person, one more student, whether they're uh whether they're a very young kid, whether they're uh in elementary school or junior high or high school or maybe a college student on your own campus because the ultimate measure of, of health successful we are is going to be how much we're able to do to bring more people along with us. And so the knowledge that kind of energy that you pick up today, I hope sustains you in your own activities. But I, I hope also helps uh you and your work as a community leader, as someone who has influence as someone whose um actions and thoughts and words uh carry a great deal of power. And uh and so with that, I just want to say thanks to all of you for making the trip here. Uh early on a Saturday morning, uh, when I know that, uh, that you've all been, uh, no doubt working hard on other things and we're getting up early this morning may not have been, uh, kind of what, what your original intention had been, uh, some time ago. We're just glad to have you here. And, um, 11 final thing for, uh, I guess I'll pass this along to Rania as, um, as the day goes on, you may find that, that you're in need of a break or something a little bit different. And uh and so given that this is, is research and I think sometimes people have um fairly defined, rigid conceptions of research. I wanted to bring along um a piece of poetry that was written by an Osage uh writer and poet named Wayne Big Eagle, uh who uh has a, a poem entitled My grandfather was a quantum physicist that some of you may have uh may be familiar with. And so if there's a, a break and you need something a little um kind of interesting and scholarly in a different way, uh I hope that this might be a benefit to you as well. Um Anyway, that's it. That's as long winded as I can get speaking for me in the Provos. And uh anyway, welcome. I'm glad that you're all here. Thanks g um What we wanted to do also is if, if the professors who brought students, if they could introduce their students, you know, their name and their field and all that kind of thing. Um So we're gonna go ahead and, and, and get started. Um So I'm gonna let the, the professor from James here do the, do the uh introductions that let me just stand up for a minute so I can uh see everybody. Um I, uh I'm very glad to, to be here again. Uh, this year, I'm kind of reflecting uh as we begin this day on what we did last year and it occurs to me that uh we've doubled in several ways. Um We've doubled in terms of the number of schools that are represented here, I think last year it was just Stanford and UC Santa Cruz. And this year we've got people from Mills College and UC Berkeley is here too. Is that right? So we're up to four schools in this area. That's exciting. Um We've doubled in the size of the room. Uh That's always uh encouraging. We didn't have, we wouldn't have had enough room if we'd been back in that old uh old space. And I've noticed too that we've doubled in the amount that uh Gil Ramirez is eating so far. I owed you one. I am. I had heard a lot of good things over the years about Jim Larimore and it's been really nice to, to get a chance to uh meet him here this morning and I feel like I've learned some things already. It, it hadn't, although I'd heard what one person he was, I didn't realize how wise and knowledgeable he is because he said everything that I wanted to say. So I know he must be wise enough. Um, he, uh, he said a lot of good things for us to keep in mind and, and, uh, I don't have, uh, too much, uh, nor should I really add to what he said? I do think this is an unusual event. Um I think that each one of us can think back in our own lives uh in uh whatever stage of the educational process that we may be in. And I mean, the, the kind of uh uh restricted institutional, formal kind of education that most of us in this room are involved in, in one way or another. There's other kinds of education, other kinds of knowledge that uh maybe uh aren't as, as widely recognized as such by a lot of people as Jim has suggested. But certainly we can all think about our experiences in the educational institutions and, and realize that an event like this is a pretty unusual uh occurrence or we can just come together uh in uh what has appropriately been been called a research forum for American Indians where we, where we uh without having to uh uh uh defend the legitimate legitimacy of, of the kinds of uh concerns and questions and topics that we are concerned. With uh before any, any kind of uh wider audience. So we can come together and talk to each other. Uh That uh that doesn't mean we all think alike, doesn't mean that we all are going to approach any given issue in the same way. Uh But that we can really come into this, this room and this space with a sense of uh of uh of community, of uh of mutual understanding and respect and concern and have a meaningful conversation. Uh We can say some things, talk about our own uh specific uh uh uh projects uh and also have a chance to learn from each other. Now, I think one of the real uh ways in which the educational system fails us is when it creates a competitive environment that says that uh your worth is dependent on your GPA or, or the comments that the, your rights on your paper or uh how you compare, you know, with other people. Uh We know uh I think from a variety of different uh kinds of backgrounds that, that kind of basis for human worth is not uh is not real uh solid. It's, it's uh actually contributes to a lot of the kinds of problems that we see in our society and in our own lives. Uh So I would just kind of call that to our attention this morning that uh we can kind of come to this with a different frame of mind with a different understanding about, uh, what a human being is and what the importance of, of human creativity is. That doesn't mean that we can't challenge each other, that we can't push each other to think about, uh, issues in ways that we haven't looked at. I know I want to be, uh, challenged. I'm, I'm unfortunately not going to be here for the whole day. I'm going to, uh, Booth Minnesota where I'm going to participate in the Tribal Colleges Consortium annual conference, something I've been looking forward to very well and uh for, for quite a long time. And uh I'm going to be giving a kind of a, a workshop, not really a, I'm not going to make a presentation so much as a workshop on some things that I've been working on in Santa Cruz. And mainly not because I think I have something to teach them, but because I want to hear what they have to say to me from the tribal college context, you know, what we do at UCC and a cruise. Uh So I think all of us can benefit from those kinds of uh feedback uh and, and, and critique but that there's a way in which we can do that that builds, builds us up as a community that builds us up as individuals rather than as in a sense of that. Uh Well, I have to show that I'm sharper than this person or I've thought about this a little more than they have or that there's any kind of a competitive, competitive uh atmosphere, you know, we're all here for a reason. Uh This, this uh forum has been facilitated and organized very uh very well by Ria and Gil Ramirez. And we owe them a lot of thanks. And I hope at the end of the day that you'll uh or throughout the day that you'll have a chance to just express uh your appreciation for their work on this. Uh But they've, they've brought each of you here, you know, for a reason. Uh And so there's, there's nobody here that has to prove uh that they have a right to be here or that they have something to say we're all kind of in this together if you will. So, um I'm just gonna uh uh stop there and maybe uh suggest a little bit about um uh process. Um One of the ways we do have to sort of accommodate to uh the kinds of uh rules and regulations we've come to know and the institution has to do with the, the problem of time. And that is, we've got a lot of people, a lot of good things to say here and, and I know uh if we were maybe out at a, at a community event or at a, at an annual uh uh uh pow hour festival of some type, maybe we could put our watches away. But uh for the purposes of getting everyone a chance to speak. We are going to have to monitor the time just a little bit. So I'm gonna, uh, at least for the morning, I'll be gone in the afternoon. You can handle it as you, as you like. But for the morning I think I'll just sit up here and I'll probably prompt people when they get to about the 10 minute mark with a slip of paper and then give them about two more minutes just to wrap it up. And then we'll uh go from there into a que time of question and answer and really be thinking about uh you know, engaging and listening, listening, actively, not just listening passively, but what are, what's really being said and what's significant about what's going on here and what might you be able to contribute? We'll also try to keep the questions to a, a fairly short format. Uh If you want to make a speech, uh talk to Randy and she'll put you on the program. But uh if you, if you just wanna, you know, add another angle of thinking about something or ask a question, that would be the appropriate way. And we'll try to get as many people involved in that dialogue as possible. In fact, I was also going to suggest if there's a couple of people uh in the, the back tables who want to move up to these two seats uh uh in the front here, there's still a couple of open if you want to be part of this uh closer circle here. So I just wanted to add that. Um I asked Robert Royer if you could help facilitate the question and answer. So, so if you want to say something, uh just kind of look at Robert and maybe just make a sign or something and then he can, you know, kind of help with that. Do you want to move up here? Anybody else that wants to, uh, just make a comment before we get going here or a response of any type to the opening? The other thing I wanted to do just before we begin is, um, which I wanted to go around the room and make sure everyone just said you their name, their tribe and um their school. So I don't know if you start back, start back here here. Uh L uh Ojibwe uh that do, uh this is Jim Larimore still from Stanford uh conventions, uh Lloyd Lee Dune from Stanford, Maar from Stanford, Jill, the nurse doctor from Stanford. Um So you have it. So you have that person that has created me to, um, from school. Certainly that those college star Harrison home and how you have a middle college, we have better, more color than I love Warrior of Sage Box. Train points to my mom from music getting Chamber and Jake Manafort Baileys and Fox, Oklahoma, UC Santa Cruz and Norris to Mansion Stanford, uh Terry Greaves, Kaiwa, U CS C and I'm James Treat uh Creek, a teacher of UC Santa Cruz.

I'm at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. I'm a long way for this symposium. Must be good. You can talk to Stanford. I'm Chris Oar when they work to Stanford. Yeah. If at the end of the day you feel like it wasn't good. Uh See Tina about getting your money back, she'll be glad to help you out. Not on the flight. Just the registration. Ok. Uh Well, let's begin then. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Uh Gil I just wanted to say to those people that are not from here have some important things. Bathrooms are downstairs, bath right here on the anyone else. Ok. We'll go ahead and get started then. Um It's my pleasure to uh introduce uh our first presenter from uh UC Santa Cruz. Terry Greaves is ka. She's listed as History of Consciousness uh which uh is sort of a wishful thinking on somebody's part, not mine. She's actually in American studies. Uh I wish I could convince her to stick around and be a grad student in his con so I could continue to work with her. But he is a graduating and uh she's uh teaching a student directed seminar this quarter, which is her last quarter, um titled I uh Engines, Red Squints Bucks and Squaws Images of Indians in American popular culture, which just started on Wednesday. She's only had one meeting. Um She's going to talk to us about her research uh which she's been working on for years. So that went into the course and then talk about her course design and some of the things, the kinds of uh methodological and theoretical issues that that raises. And I think it's a topic that we all can relate to uh at some level and uh hopefully will provoke some uh good discussion that may actually uh be uh feed into her course too. So, Terry, um well, like you said, I'm teaching this class and um well, I guess I'm gonna be a little more auto bio autobiographical than, than theoretical. But um the reason why I started this, this class was going to be my thesis. And the reason why I started looking into images of Indians is because um my mom owned an in an arts and crafts store on Wind River reservation in Wyoming and my entire life. Um all the money that we've survived off of um has come from selling uh Indian things. And has come from, um, consumers want of, of those Indian things and that identity. And, um, I remember being a little girl and, um, my mother always used to keep our hair in braids and um we used to play in front of the store and the white tourists would, um, ask us for photographs and sometimes they give us money for it and sometimes they wouldn't. But, um, we thought it was all fun and good and, you know, we get like five bucks out of the deal. And, um, basically, I guess they would come to the reservation on their way to Yellowstone Park to, to see Indians and they saw us, which was sort of funny because we're Kyle and Comanche. We're not, we're not Shoshone or a r from the reservation, you know. And, um, so part of, part of what my mother does is, um, she sells herself along with, um, the arts and crafts. She dresses sort of like the old ladies on the reservation dress and she's always dressed like that from as long as I can remember, like before I was born. And, um, that is one of the biggest selling parts, uh, points to the things that she sells in her store. She's now in Santa Fe and, um, last summer when I was in Santa Fe visiting, I was hanging out in the store with her and, um, she was standing there and my mother's like, you know, 60 now and um she was standing there and this white woman came in and saw her and thought she was just the cutest thing in the world and ran right over to her and grabbed a hold of her braids and sort of yanked on him like and said, oh, you're so cute. You're so cute. And um I remember like looking at that and just being obviously like appalled and wanting to hit this woman. But, um, my mom who's like deals with this on a daily basis was very composed and said to her, please don't touch my hair. And I saw over this woman's face a sudden realization that she was dealing with a human being and not a doll, not, not, not this cute little Indian woman to be fondled or touched or bought or whatever. And, um, I don't know. So that's, that's what's led me to look into these to look into what, what we're seen as and how we create ourselves, the way that my mother has created herself because in a way she's brought this upon herself. Uh, I mean, she could dress like a white person and blend in and, um, she doesn't, she sticks herself out and she does it for survival. And it's more than just, um, it's more than just survival of money. It's cultural survival also. And, um, so let's see. So I've been working on this research for like almost two years now and I've come up with this really huge bibliography. Um, it, part of it is annotated and part of it is un annotated. The last six pages are un annotated and it's all information books, periodicals, articles, films that I've come up with that all deal with this issue in one way or another. And, um, I'd be happy to give this out. I'd really like this information and get out there. I hold no claim to it at all. And the more people who look at it and think about it the better. And the one thing that I found and the way that I structured my course was is there's two approaches to um Indian images and uh Indian identity from the out on the outside. And the first one comes from a white perspective which looks at the images as created by white people and uh imposed. And then there's, there's in the last I'd say maybe, maybe even 10 years, not even that long. There's a whole bunch of Indian research and Indian writing and thinking um that sees Indian identity as um that we have agency in creating our Indian identity, the way that my mother dresses up and, and sells herself. And um so what was I gonna say? 01 of the films that I'm looking at um is by a Hopi filmmaker. His name is Victor Mava. I'm probably totally slaughtering that name. But um he did this film called Imagining Indians. And it's an excellent film and it brings up issues that for Native Americans, which is not a lot, most of what I found, um, doesn't bring up those issues for Native Americans and, um, what he writes about or what he, what he visually shows is, uh, Indians dealing with this, this thing of, of having responsibility for what we allow to be consumed, what we allow to be commodified. And, um, one of the things that he talks about is um is sacred items that are now for sale are sacred items that have been turned into tourist, um tourist items like uh pipe bags or something like that. And um how we help that, we help, we help, we help in losing the sacred of our communities by, by doing that by allowing things to be commodified. And it's something that I personally have a lot of interest in because I'm a bead worker. It's like I haven't had a, like a real job uh for the last, I don't know, five or six years and I've made most of my money in the last few years on bead work and what I create uh holds huge implications. Um What I decide to allow to be sold the designs I decide to use. Um It, it, it can be extremely appropriate and a really sticky situation, the more I think about it. So, um he talks about Victor Mava talks about this uh responsibility that we have as Indian people to our own identity and, um, and, um, keeping the sacred, sacred and using our good judgment, using, uh, not letting money talk all the time. And it's a really difficult lesson for me to learn because I'm poor and I really need the money. But, um, I don't know. Uh, let's see. I don't know, like what else to say about this. I'm teaching this class and unfortunately, most of the students in my class are white and I don't think that we're going to get into those issues that um I would like to get into. Um and they're really issues that maybe only Indians can talk about because it's our identity that's at stake. And um we're the ones that need, need to take control over the theorizing and the writing that's done on uh who we are and how the, how our, how, what our image is uh to the public. And um I don't know, I think I'm gonna stop there because I could go into like greater detail about things like particulars that I found out about images, but you know, that might be boring. Thanks, sir. Um Are there problems people had for up to that Mr if you use two terms of presentation, sacred and culture, how would you define those terms? Oh jeez. Um Well, I can only ans answer personally. II, I don't know how else to answer and I can only answer uh from experience and identity is such a twisted thing in America. And uh it, it has to do with race and for Indians, it has to do with blood quantum. And for me, my understanding is I've seen Indians that aren't really Indians, you know what I mean? Blood quantum, they're not recognized and it's a culture that ends up ultimately defining how they're received by their communities. And um so in a way, I think that culture do, I sound like an anthropologist? I don't know. I mean, I do, but I think that uh I think that culture really defines a great deal of, of, of our identity obviously. And what was the other term sacred? Um Now that's really sticky, that's like terribly sticky. Um Well, the way that Victor was using it in this film was uh those things that are central to our identity and um those things that are central to our identity can be seen as culture. They can also be seen as a form of faith or religion. I don't like the word religion. It seems too institutional. I like the word faith better because it can come in any form. And I think that they're sacred for all people, not just Indians, obviously. And um I don't know, I guess that's how I define it. I don't know if the answer to your question, teacher, I have a question when you're teaching in this group and you know, the white students in there, are they, are you getting the sense from them that they're reinforcing those ideas about objectifying Indians as a crucial commodity. Are you trying to undo it? Do you see that coming from them or they wanting to take that and again, go out and learn enough to, again follow that path? Um, I've only had one class meeting so I can't tell you. And that's kind of an unfair question but just even thinking about it because I always teach in classes that are primarily white students. Those too. Yeah. Yeah. Um Well, you know, my hope is that I won't be reinforcing the stereotypes. And I think that I think that the strategy that I'm going to use is to constantly refer back to myself because I'm a living model, right? Standing in front of them, breathing in front of them. And I have these stories, hopefully they won't get bored by them. But I have all these stories of what uh how I mean, my mom's in the art business and the art business is all about identity. It's all about image. I mean, image is the first thing that sells, the art comes later. And um if I can in some way, use my life as a um as an example to show them maybe insights that they're not going to get by reading. You know, there's a really excellent book called The White Man's Indian. I'm sure you know it Burke offer and you can't get that from Burke offer. You know what I mean? It comes from a different perspective. So I just hope by just physically being there is going to like, push it, push the issue past those stereotypes. I don't know if it's gonna work or not. I've heard all kinds of horror stories about how it doesn't work. So we'll see you want to talk about how your course design is, addresses this issue as well in terms of the first half of the second half of films you're using. Yeah, the first half of the course is, um, is all uh work written by non indents. Uh And the film I'm only showing one film, um is Thunder Heart and they're all, um, they come from the white perspective and some of them is, it's just some of it's really excellent work and I, I really appreciate that some of it is very uh controversial and I really appreciate that too. And hopefully in the class, we can see how controversial and how almost uh like polar opposite it is from the Indian created writing and analysis, which is the second half of the course. And the I'm using three films. They're all films um by Indian people, Navajo talking pictures, Imagining Indians and Herald of Orange. And um I think in particular Imagining Engines, Indians and Herald of Orange are like two. Like they, when I watched Imagining Indians for the first time, I was like, yes, this is exactly what I want to try to get across in my course, this film and if they can understand that film at the, by the end of the class, I'll be really happy, I'll be really happy. I'll have succeeded. And I think you can really answer my questions and help me to deal with the issue of identity. We have two a, a couple of audiences, I think one nous as well. And um so I was wondering if I ask how uh are there involved to change attitudes? So I was wondering how you can do that, make it powerful of prey in the area. My question, the class is a discussion class. It is not a lecture class. I, I cannot imagine myself lecturing like that just seems really foreign to me. Um So, and the other thing that I have going for me is I'm a student, I'm totally equal level. I don't have an office. I don't have, you know, a super like professor's box at the steno pool or whatever. Well, actually that's not true. I do. But um but anyway, it, I there, it's like a, it's like a almost a level playing field that I'm coming from, that professors don't have. And I hope that, I mean that when we're out in the real world, isn't that where when we connect with another person, when we really connect, it's, it's when we feel like we're on, in, on a level playing field when we can really hear what they're saying. Um, so I'm hoping that that's gonna come through. I don't know. We'll see at the end of the quarter when I'm not graduating because my class is a total failure. We'll see when my students hate my guts. Mhm. I think I'm taking the hard line. I, I just wanted to ask you if you have any questions, you know, from, from your experience, if you might wanna ask, pose any questions here. Since we all, I know different people are here in the room with the wide Yeah. One. Well, I don't know, I guess my question would be, um, I keep coming back to this film by Victor Maiava, which it just, it's a, it's an incredible film and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Um, and he shows the scene of these, um, these paintings on, um, on a rock wall and he's talking about, um, like looking back through time, how we, how once we used to make these things for survival, for life and then somewhere along the line, money started to be exchanged for these items. And then somewhere along the line after that, we stopped, we stopped claiming responsibility for that whole process of exchange for survival, maybe not seeing it or seeing it in the same light or not seeing it in the same light. And, um, and I just wonder, like, I mean, that's like I said, it's like a really difficult question for me. To deal with, like, my own responsibility to what I do to the art that I do. And, um, and, but at the same instance I do feel this responsibility to the sacred, whatever the heck that is. I don't know. And, um, I don't know. I guess my question is, what do people think about that? I mean, it's, of course, I think, like, people have always Indian, people have always done that but to a certain extent, like with the, I can see it in the movie industry better than any, in any other industry is um uh Indian film stars walking into roles that maybe are not the best roles to be walking into and uh doing it for money and then not liking to hear any criticism of them coming from the Indian community for doing that and saying, oh, well, the Indian community is poor and where this is a way that I'm getting out of it. But in a way it compromises our identity. Can I um just uh add something to that based on some conversations that we've had in my office that she hasn't quite said it this way. But I think some of the things that I've uh learned from Terry in terms of the questions that she's asking that she's posing to, to the people in this room is that um it's one thing for us to stand up and lament the commodification of Indian culture or the appropriations. Uh inappropriate, the inappropriate appropriations committed in the name of New Age spirituality and on down the list. But what happens when we acknowledge that Indian people both today and in the past have, have been active participants, not all Indian people, but there have been some, what do we do when we acknowledge any people have been participating in that? And, and the question is not a question of politics. It's not a question of laying blame so much as it's an intellectual question which is to ask what going on culturally, what's the significance of that? It's not that it's not that by acknowledging that Indian people have been participating in it, that thereby we can't blame nonin Indians for, for what they're doing. It's, it's, it's an intellectual question as I understand the way you're approaching it is she's really asking the question, what does this mean for us? You know, what does this mean about Indian culture? What, what does it tell us? What kinds of questions does it ask? So, I haven't heard you say it quite that way today, but that's what I picked up in our conversations as you worked on this research. I I'll make a quick comment. I mean, I get on questions. I think it illustrates to Terry and James that represents a crisis uh intellectually, but also the level of responsibility. There's a moment I think I talk about the same uh Messiahs film of uh Rodney Grant and Dances with wolves. I get a comment in that film is, it's the same one, right? And, and where he, where, where Victor poses him, the question about commodified himself. Basically, what roles do you take? Which ones do you not take? Uh, and he, uh, and, and one of the questions is, well, are you going to take responsibility for creating a native American film industry for films by native American directors? Like Victor, would you, would you take $5000 to do a film with me instead of a million dollars to do a film over here? And, and, and Rodney Grant ends up um uh sort of just sort of avoiding the question. He doesn't want to talk about it. He, and, and there's a way in which that the film problematic for me, an avoidance of, of, of a real crisis and the why I think it's really interesting topic to bring up is there's also not among uh uh Indian writers uh enough theorizing about uh about this question of responsibility because it's a really difficult issue. And, and, and teaching is actually one of those places where you have to confront it and, and, and I mean, you'll find that out, everyone here who, who is taught finds that out as well, uh where generally you are in, in situations where you are somehow standing in as a representative of, of lots and lots of people and lots of points of view no matter how much you don't wanna be. That's the situation you're faced with, um, a, as a teacher. And so you'll have to, it at that point. There's a wonderful side of that. There's also a really sticky part of it too. Um, and, and I find that those people who really want to embrace that and say, yeah, I wanna be that person. Uh, that, that's when you run into problems. If you're, if you're too eager to go into that situation. Say, yeah, I'll represent the Indian voice to all of these people. Um, so, um, it's, it's a huge issue. It'll probably come up all day. Um, we went with some other questions. You, yes. Uh, bring out, uh, many big questions, many, uh, big issue. I'm not sure that I understand everything, but there is one issue that you bring out and it really touch me. It's the question of art and money. Uh, because I'm a person in pain and I use a painful to know issues more myself and also to try to come in with other person who shares what I know or what. I don't know with my art and you just involve the question of sending because we have to survive. I need to leave with the art that I'm doing and presently I'm not ready to send my art because I don't know exactly why and I'm not ready to paint to please the public what they want because the art for me is something more deep and I decided that you when we involve this question, but I don't have all the answers, but I just share your, your fear uh with this because in art, I think there is something very deep and it's really personal. But at the same time, I think that there is something universal in art, there is a kind of spirit inside art. Then with money, there is something that I don't let us have. That's another one. Um, yeah, the, I had my presentation last time which I will try not to get into, um, basically dealt with this, uh, about, about Indian art because Indian art is really defined in like many different ways and it's defined by time. And, um, antique Indian art is worth way more than Indian art, uh, presently made. But then within the presently made Indian art, certain types of art are considered crafts that anybody can do bead work, feather work, woodwork, anything like that. And then there's another type of art that is considered fine art or high art pottery, uh, modern paintings, um, baskets like that. And there will be like, if you go into Santa Fe, there's like one whole gallery dedicated just to pots and they're not old pots, they're pots that are currently made. And my question is why isn't there a store dedicated also to bead work? There is, but it's a mass produced bead work. Um, and I, I just, I question like, what, what's going on there just within the, within the market itself that defines what art is. And there's, uh, something coming up on the, on the thing about looking at Indian history and, um, something about terms of Indian history and, and I think that part of that, yeah, problems the term of traditional culture because a lot of the modern, uh, artwork that's being made by Indians is, uh, traditionally based, but maybe not like, you know, beaded tennis shoes or something like that with traditional designs on it. It's like, how do you define that? And how does the market define that? So we live in, you know, a market driven economy and in an art is just like any other commodity. So we have to deal with that, but maybe with that, we'll, we'll let people comment during lunch and during the breaks and things um deter, but I thought that was, it was great. So for those of you who are uh following along the schedule and uh correlating it with the watch on your, on the end of your arm, uh We, we, we were going to deal with the time we started about 15 minutes late, we're just gonna be about 15 minutes behind and we'll have lunch at about 1215. So you don't have to get, get nervous or antsy if the room is still about 10 minutes behind of one, that's our plan for right now. Our next speaker is, uh, Jacob Manito Bailey, uh, SAC and Fox. Uh, and, uh, I wish Jacob were an American studies major. He's taken a lot of courses in American studies, but unfortunately he was seduced by the Community studies board, uh, because they would allow him to do a six month, uh, field internship. Uh, and he's gonna be going to Oklahoma, Oklahoma, uh, to work with the sack and Fox, uh, at the end of the spring quarter, is that right? We'll be back until, until the first of the year. Um And uh he's been involved in a number of uh projects on campus and one of the most important has to do with uh the repatriation uh process at UC Santa Cruz. Um He has uh been doing an internship and uh has uh uh learned a great deal about our collections, probably the second most knowledgeable person on the campus right now about the uh the uh small collection that we have of, of uh Indian remains uh at UC Santa Cruz. And, and uh uh has also uh taken it uh in his own characteristic uh characteristically intellectual way and some very, raising some very broad questions about uh the, the relationship uh both the uh institutional and intellectual between the discipline of anthropology and the American Indian community. And so has a number of interesting points to raise and he's gonna talk about uh the whole repatriation situation at U CS C so objective. Well, I might get that far. I'm not sure yet. Um, one of my nicknames for Terry is boss and I'll tell you that because I'm gonna be following a lot of what she said and what I wanna discuss today and repatriation as it has been defined stands for. And this is a legal definition, the return of sacred objects, human remains unassociated, funerary goods and items of cultural patrimony to American Indian nations. And the repatriation currently is largely discussed within the terms and defined within the terms of NAG PRO, which is the Native American Graves Repatriation and Protection Act, which was passed in 1990. And I say I want to follow Terry because I want to talk about images, uh stereotypes, assumptions, responsibility, a lot of the same issues. And I also wanna follow her by starting with this story about my mother because my mother went, when my mother was going to school, there was no such thing as Native American studies. There was no such thing as Indian education. If she wanted to have anything to do with Indians in the college stadium, he went into anthropology and a lot of Indians went into anthropology and some of them made it and a lot more didn't make it. And my mom was one of those. Um she dropped out of college and I grew up with stories about the crazy things that anthropologists thought about Indians and the even sicker things that they did to our dead. And when I first started, and I'm really glad that there's a lot of anthropology students on this sheet, maybe. Uh we can get a little dialogue going here cause I have a lot of problems. Um I've, I've always grown up with a lot of assumptions and a lot of stereotypes about anthropologists. And when I first started re researching repatriation, um I uncovered horror story after horror story about past and current anthropological practice. And it reinforced a lot of the ideas I had about anthropology and what it does and what it has done to Indian people. And at the same time, I've had sort of a morbid fascination with the strange creatures and sort of the rituals that they seem to love to carry out. And those were the terms that I always thought about anthropology and anthropologists when I started interning at the University of California, Santa Cruz Archaeological Collection, um the repatriation debate and I shouldn't use the word debate. I shouldn't even use the word movement. I should use the word war because that's the way that both a lot of natives and a lot of non natives writing about and uh about repatriation have defined it. They've defined it as a war as a war of science versus religion. A war of objective, cold, analytical anthropologist versus warm spiritual Indians. Um And a lot of the titles of articles written by both natives and non natives. A lot of prominent people are things like science or sacrilege, disputing the dead preservation or re aal native Americans versus American museums. A battle for artifacts. And so this is the mindset that, that prevails in a lot of places. And it was the mindset that I had when I started interning at the anthropology department. That was an extremely difficult process for me. You know, you walk into this building, it's called Social Sciences. One, I normally refer to it as the evil building and it's this big concrete monolith. You know, you walk up two stairss of floor, the air starts to get stale, the posters that start to appear on the wall, paleolithic culture and planes, material items in the final area area, you know, and people are, are talking in languages that I can't understand. And I get to the fourth floor where they keep the bodies and I start getting pretty whacked out. Um When I first started my internship, I could only think of things in either or situations. It was either I go in there and I lay my agenda out on the table or I hide it and I compromise my sense of integrity. And every, every, every situation that I found myself in was a set of either or statements. No, neither of which I was happy with. And eventually what I was forced to do for my own sanity and to get anywhere in working to help the repatriation process was that I had to, I had to go out on a limb. I had to put myself out there and I had to explain to my supervisor who's an archaeologist and my coworker who is an archaeology student that I had a lot of fear and a lot of anger about what was going on. And I was amazed, I was absolutely amazed at the emotional responses that I got from those people and what they told me about how they felt and how, how they had become sick, how they felt forces and how hard it was for them to be involved in such a thing. And we really begin to build bridges to facilitate AAA way of thinking about repatriation. That wasn't us versus them. It wasn't me carrying a banner going in there to get rid of anthropology. And I think that Indians have a lot of stereotypes about anthropologists. Anthropologists have a lot of stereotypes about Indians and the dominant society has stereotypes about both of them, which feed into a rhetoric which divides us and this one and this is when it comes to survival and when it comes to responsibility, like Terry was talking about is that anthropologists the most of them when you, when I've really sat down and talked with them, the, the basic thing that comes out is that they love Indians, the who that they love Indians, that they feel a responsibility towards Indians. That the whole reason they went into their field is because they wanted to help Indians and they got into the field and then they found out that they had to do these certain things, which wasn't what they thought. And they ended up interacting with objects and with remains and not with live human beings. And repatriation has forced a lot of anthropologists to, and a lot of Indians to get over their fear about each other and to come together to work on projects to, to try to resolve this crisis. And anthropologists and I use the term so generally and so broadly, and I refer to such a huge group of people. But there, there's a, there's a, a narrative that's emerging which is trying is trying to succeed. The one that's of us versus them, which says we can work together and we can work together to do some important things. So that's the first sort of issue I wanna pose. Um the second issue I want to pose is see, how do I put this is about how the rhetoric around repatriation talks about Indians and about how they feel about spirits and their ancestors and desecration and things like this in a way that really disturbs me and it disturbs me because it's not tribally specific and it's not guided by that. For instance, there ne there's a National Network committee and they have field meetings which are helping, helped to formulate po policy. And at one of these field meetings, there was uh a presentation which rep represented the Indian viewpoint for that, for that segment. And the people who got up there were political activists and they basically said that, you know, all these bones need to go back in the ground. Um And we don't care what they are. We don't care if they're Chinese, we don't care if they're Jewish. We don't care what tribe they are there. The spirits have been disturbed, the spirits have been disturbed and we need to put them at peace. And repatriation was a an intertribal movement to deal with some very serious issues, dangerous, dangerous issues, powerful issues, things that I don't poss uh that I cannot possibly understand. And my solution is to look to the people in my community like I'm going for six months to intern with the Sack and Fox Repatriation Committee which is made up of elders. And their response is that they need to move extremely slow. They need to be extremely careful because they're dealing with very powerful and dangerous issues and that they need to be guided by the traditional beliefs in the traditional ways that have guided them in everything else they do. And what I see going on a lot of other places is these remains, these ancestors become a war trophy. We will get, we will get these bones back from you. Anthropologists. We will take them and put them in the ground where they belong and that's a, that attitude. I don't, I don't know what to think about it because I don't know where it's coming from. And I have a lot of, a lot of documentation that I've been finally like finding lately. For instance, there was this case in, there was this case in Kentucky, um, at a place called Slag Farm and 1200 shiny bodies were, were taken out of the ground by pot hunters. And Indian people immediately responded because of the desecration. But in addition to ceremonies to put to rebury those people, uh a proposal for 100 and $57,000 to bring 700 elders of the International Elders Council came up. A local news story forecasted up to 100 100,000 Indians could be expected to show up for the reburial. The Evansville Convention and Visitors Bureau sent out housing forms to all tribal of offices because they expected huge crowds to materialize. Um Members of the re the reburial committee started claiming that it would be the largest gathering of tribal hierarchy. This century, a concert was proposed a powwow, a sidewalk art show. Uh Hollywood stars would arrive according to one of the organizers of the event, it became an event and these, these are Indian people. Um Eventually the 22 of the organizers took off with $30,000 that they'd raised and nowhere could I find that the Shawnee had had anything to do with this So, I think James was, passed me a little note here and I'll stop right there. Mm. Um, it's great. What, what questions people have. I'm in here. Um, I'm sort of wondering about whether you, you actually believe it's wrong for, um, groups who aren't directly affiliated with these remains to lobby for their reburial. And, and the example I, I think of is, uh, a few years back, um, a group of Indian tribes from Southern New England reburied, uh the remains of some niantic Indians. There are no uh there is no neander tribe extant today. And you know, the the Indians were, were buried on the, on the uh po reservation, the uh tribal medic medicine man of the Wampanoag Indians and the medicine man of the um I think it was past m quality were uh presiding over the over the ceremony. Um And they were buried this uh this, these remains in a, in a very pan tribal uh manner. They didn't necessarily do it in, in the authentic niantic way, whatever that that was. But they, you know, at least return these things to the ground, which they knew was, you know, the tradition of the antics to actually bury the right the remains. But, you know, had they not done that these remains would have stayed in uh a museum or wherever they were, you know, forever because there would have been no n antics to claim to claim them back all right, the, the National Committee, um their basic and this is of course rumor because I have not personally talked to the National committee, but the grapevine says that the na the national committee which is made up of, I think four Indians and three nonn is saying that any Native American is closer to and of human remain. That's of Native American descent than any nonn is. And consequently, we will act on that, that prerogative. Now, if there are remains, which have no, which have no tribal affiliation, I don't know, I don't know what to do about that. I don't have an answer for you. But what I'm saying is that a lot of people are saying we're tired of waiting. We're gonna, we want to do this now. No more, no more consultation, no more discussing it. We want those bones back in the ground. And my concern with that is is that when I talk to tribal elders, they're saying we need to take this very slow. We need to be very careful. We need to have a lot of discussion. We need the, the sacrifice repatriation policy. I have it with me says that we need the opinion of every single member of the tribe and we need all of their knowledge because no one can handle this alone. This needs to be a collective, a collective pursuit, a collective effort. And so when a rash decision is made, and I'll use an example which strikes close to home and I'll use it without names. But this university Stanford did a repatriation several years ago um of a lone individuals. And it's unclear what type of consultation process happened. But there are a loney individuals today who will not talk to other Aloni individuals because of the way that reburial was handled because the people who ended up receiving the remains to put them in the earth carried out ceremonies in a way that they found to be spiritual violence. And the, and the words that, that, that they used was that it reminded them of when the Nazis buried Jews in mass graves and all they could do was go home and pray and purify themselves. Now, I don't know if that individual speaks for the traditional Aloni. I don't know anything about it. All I know is that if someone had been more careful, had taken longer to, to engage in a process to make sure that there was unity uh in the tribe on how to, how to move forward on this, then there, there wouldn't be that, that issue. And for me it's like it, it's so, it's so dangerous and Indian people have waited so long to ha to have this, that, you know, a few more years to work out some problems among you isn't gonna, isn't going to hurt anything. You know, it, it to wait to wait three, even three or four years until you, your your tribe or your community or whatever has come to, has come to a consensus on how to handle the issue and has designated people specifically to, to handle these matters then that's, that's better than rushing it. No, it's not, it's not an issue that can be rushed. Do you think they can actually achieve that sort of un unanimity? Well, I don't, I don't know about all tribes. Um, the sack and fox, I think are going to from the, the way we're, we're, it's going, you know, the Hopi, for instance, they have, they have four archaeologists who work for them. They have a, they have an archaeological program and it's overseen by 18 clan elders and priests. Now, I don't know how the Hopi feel about that, but it sounds like something that's better than, you know, giving up bones or, or sacred objects when there is still some doubt about who should be receiving those. Th this repatriation I have and this is my personal opinion is not an activist issue. You know, this is not, this is not primarily a political issue, it's primarily a spiritual issue and a cultural issue and it's not something to carry banners around about. There is a, there is, there is a proper way which needs to be directed by people who have knowledge. I don't know, I don't know how to, I don't know how to handle a repatriation and I would never go do that. Can I just chip in here because I think it's a really good question. And obviously there as, as you know, there, there are also a great number of remains which aren't even tribally identified, whether they still exist as a community or not. So this is going to be a continued problem. It seems to me that one way of answering this, that's suggested by the work that Jacob has done is that I think what Jacob has done very well is he's developing a distinction between responsibility and ownership and, and what he's trying to do is to show how, why those two things being very different, have very different implications for how this is handled, whether it's on a tribal or an intertribal level. I think he's trying to suggest that if, if the, if the bones are approached to something which is owned over, which there can be a political battle, then it doesn't matter whether it's a tribe doing it or whether it's the National Congress of American Indians, you're gonna run into inappropriate potentials, potential for inappropriate kinds of actions. If it's approached as a, as a problem of responsibility rather than of ownership, then again, it can, there can be appropriate solutions to either tribal or intertribal uh problems that come up in the repatriation process. I mean, I don't personally, I don't have any problem with um uh you know, the propriety of these people because I see that as an example of taking response now, whether, whether within their own rhetoric, they viewed it as a political battle and they approached it as something they owned. I don't know. But I'm saying that it suggests a model of responsibility rather than an ownership. And it seems to me that's one really the important thing I'm learning out of your work is, is how to understand those issues. And maybe I should be more specific in, in terms of the law. Like one of the ways that that institutions determine who they, who they repatriate remains to is they look at the IC C map, which is the Indian Claims Commission map, which is a map that is only accurate for certain periods of time and has a lot to do with the political influence and the legal influence of the tribes who took cases before the Indian Claims Commission, for example, the Sioux have a huge area on the map. And if that's the map that they're using and then the only and they go ahead and repatriate to the sues without doing any other further consultation. And that comes up later on that they have more documentation that says that those belong to, you know, another tribe or something like that. It, it can cause division within the community as well as a huge public relations problem for the institution. I I have a couple of comments. I was on the Pari Committee at Berkeley when I was a student there. And it was a war because it was Indian and non Indian on that committee and we battled every meeting and I have a box full of the material that we produced and had to read in addition to all of our classes. So it's not an easy solution. There is division, not in my tribe in Oklahoma, but the same Florida. Um They found some remains in Northern Florida by Tampa. And as Sentinels were most likely descendants of those remains, they contacted the tribe and asked them if they wanted to have that. So, uh James Billy, the tribal chairman went up there and said, yes, I want to take this land and turn it into trust land because it's our bone. And then he needed me the bingo there because the land was trying to trust land and that's caused tremendous division in the nation down there. And the repercussions are still being felt. And some people said, how could he take an area that was sacred and remains? I mean, he didn't do it right on the burial ground. But certainly it's very difficult to take land and internally to trust land. The government is very unwilling to do that at this point. And um I haven't checked recently because I embroiled in several nations in Oklahoma right now. But um what is happening too is that it's causing division uh for the, the people in there who have questions about that. So when I get the paper from down there, they're still asking. And James said I always intended to do this. You just didn't understand that this was my idea in the beginning. Uh, because the other people saying, how could you set up a bingo? I get another, uh, bingo parlor, even though it does bring in tremendous revenue and it's another consistent family field. But it isn't a simple answer. And certainly the very fact that the Seminole nation isn't even formed until after contact has another gratification in it for those people to, or who the most likely just, it is problematical one more. Then we'll take this. I just wanna comment. I, I also, uh, like I said, I'm new to Stanford, but I also wanted to Mac book people that didn't invite as part of their group to participate. We've only met a couple of times and they talked about the colony Pari more of that. But, uh, people felt that way because, you know, I've, I serve on that committee and I'm the only my only Indian on there. Um There used to be two of us but, uh, the woman's gone. Um, but, you know, I, I can only speak for, you know, what I believe in what I think, you know, I know about my tribe and that it's very difficult when you ask and, you know, I don't speak, you know, I don't represent the end voice of all of you. But certainly, uh I try, you know, I do this my best I can to talk about. Now, you mentioned about the sacredness and so forth. Uh, that's a, that's a big issue for me because, you know, I come from a Pueblo that's very, you know, very still traditional and a whole lot of these things are sacred and I've seen victory here. Yeah. When you were reading that article about, uh, the Kentucky is, uh, interesting because a couple years ago ha uh received a lot of uh there were no um bones or anything bodies, but a lot of um Smithsonian repatriated a lot of uh sacred islands that have been taken. And the news people in Albuquerque were just, you know, I really wanted uh you know, to come in and, and document and film the whole thing, you know, and um it was just, it was just really crazy, but it was like the same thing as, as a Hopi. It was our priests and our clan leaders and those people that were involved in this whole thing and the governors made an appearance at the airport, you know, just to do it quick. So the press were here, blah, blah, blah, and we're going home and that was it. We didn't allow anybody back on the reservation. And then once we, you know, the items were brought to the reservation, they just brought them into the plaza and straight into the Kasi's house. And that was it there. Was no. Uh we still don't know to this day what was there.
