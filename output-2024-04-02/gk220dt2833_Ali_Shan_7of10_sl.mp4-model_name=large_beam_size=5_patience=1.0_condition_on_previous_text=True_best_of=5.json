{"text": "okay so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions that'll help me better understand the journey so you were talking about when the gunman took you with him do you remember what that journey was like and what you saw along the way oh not really much because all we were traveling and I was always wondering what's going to happen to me and where he's taking me he didn't explain to me anything so we used to at night we used to spend in a village along the way and where we get food and everything and rested and then start another day so that's all I remember going through the fields you know see walk through fields all day yeah and then what about eating during the day where did you eat oh we pick up the food from the village along the way so he was arrested during the day in hot weather under the trees or somewhere so we ate whatever we got there he got I didn't know but he was getting food from somewhere you know from the village along the way so that way we spent the day and what were the people like in the villages along the way oh they were I don't know what story he was telling them so I didn't know much about it but they were okay were there other children that you saw no and then when you went into your new family how was that how many family members did they have there were two children two boys husband wife and husband's older brother they were all together about five of them yeah their older son was about 16 15 16 the younger one was about my age what was a typical day like with that family I used to go out in the village in the farm help there wherever I could yes I every day I used to go to the farm yeah so whatever I could do I built away did their children also go to the farm yes and what about school no school none of you guys went to school I don't really know did anyone come to teach at home no what are the memories that you have from living in that family anything that really stuck to you that you oh only stick out to me is that I was treated well I was given the same food but they were eating so but still I was not comfortable because I knew that I was not one of them and I had my family which I don't have anymore so I just resolved to my life whatever was there available to me so that was it very frustrating very I was so quiet. I was not having any fun anywhere. I was just cut to myself. Did you play with any other children? No, I would come home and stay home because mostly I was scared. Because I was so fresh, what happened to me and my family. So not much I could do. And did they know your real name at any point? Yes, they did. They knew my name, they knew my village where I come from and all that, yes. How did they know all that? The guy told them. How did the guy know your name? Because he asked me. He took me along the way. He asked me my name and my family and all sort of things. And my father, who I was and what happened to him and all that. Yeah, I told him everything. Do you remember the name? Or did you in any way hear the name of the person who took you? No. And so when they came to find you, did you have any idea what was going on? Yeah, no, because what happened was this. There was some incident when the military went to recover. Girls and boys, they used to hide them so they couldn't find them. So and they didn't have enough time to look around. So they came, first time they came during the day and I was not there. I was in the fields. So they told them he's not here. So they went back, they didn't ask any question where he was. So then the guy who told them who I was, and they went to him, they said that we couldn't find the boy there. And because my cousin was, my father's cousin was involved, he wanted to find me. So he went to the person who informed them about my, me living there. So, he, he said go at night. I will be there at that time, at night. So they came and I had about 9, 30, 10 o'clock. So one person knocked the door and they didn't know who it was. As soon as the door opened, there was a boot, sounds of boots and a lot of people were talking to each other. So then all of a sudden one of them said, where is the Muslim boy? So I was upstairs with the, one of their sons. Sleeping upstairs. So they came upstairs and they asked, who's the Muslim boy? So I stood up. Then they brought me downstairs and I was crying. I was nowhere. What was going on? So I was so scared. I didn't want to go with him. So then one of the soldier told my uncle's cousin who was there, they told him to take me on one side and tell, tell me all my background, my family. So then I will be more calm and go with them. So he took me on one side and told me about my father's name and my uncle's names and about the village and all that. So then I was kind of satisfied that he's, he knows the family, so he'll be okay to go with. So I went with them to the, to Ludhiana. There, because I had long hair at that time. And I had simple clothes. So he went, took me to the barber, cut my hair and bought new clothes for me. So then I would live there for two weeks after. Then I was transferred to Pakistan, in the refugee camp. And where did you live in Ludhiana? Oh, I don't remember. It was where the soldiers were living. They had a one area, and it was reserved for the, all the refugees who they recovered. They used to stay there until the bus was ready, busload was ready to transfer to Pakistan. And you know about the first time when they came to look for you, who told you that story? How did you find out about that? Because when I came home in the evening, at that time the family talked about it. Oh, and what did you think when you heard them talk about it? No, I didn't know. I, as I said, you know, I was too young to know who they were, they were looking, why they're looking for me. And because I went to that tragedy, what happened, so I was scared anyway. I was not sure where somebody would take me, and who they are, and where they're coming from, why they're looking for me. Nothing at all. And how did you find out that it was one of the boys from that family who had tipped off? That, after that, my father's cousin, he told me after that, when he recovered me, and he told me that's where he found me, that that boy came and told them where I was and who I was and all that. So can you describe the journey to the refugee camp? Who were the people that were with you? How did you get there? When they put us on the bus, I didn't know anybody in the bus. I didn't know anybody out anywhere. My father's cousin couldn't come with us because he was in the military, so he got to stay there. So he wrote a letter to his cousin, my uncle, that I was found, and I will be in refugee camp, but because of the mail, so slow, they couldn't get it for two months, the letter. So by the time they got the letter, in the meantime, my mother's brother came and picked me up from there, and took me with him to his house in Kasumar. Can you describe the refugee camp? It was huge. It used to be a jail before, with the high walls and a big, huge courtyard. And they emptied the jail and made it a refugee camp. And where was this? What city? In Lahore, on Jail Road, it used to be called Jail Road at that time, that road. So that's where it was. So where did you sleep and what did you eat? I would sleep on the floor, and there was food provided both times, morning and evening. And that's where it was, in the refugee camp. I myself was looking in the refugee camp, that I could find some family members. I couldn't find anybody, so I resolved myself, I don't know what's going to happen now. I was just staying there every day. Did you talk to anyone? No. Nobody talked to me. I didn't talk to anybody, as well. What were the people like, from your observation? Oh, everybody was terribly frightened and confused, because all the people over there, they have lost their family contact and everything. They didn't know where their families were, all the girls and boys, or young girls, older girls, whoever they were. So nobody knew what to do. Yeah. What to do, what not to do. And they were waiting for their relatives to come there and find them. That was the only way. There was no contact whatsoever. And nobody knew who survived, who didn't. And I didn't know myself, that how many family members, or my cousins, uncles, or anybody, cousins who survived or who didn't. I didn't know at that time. What were the general ages of the people, you think, in the refugee camp? The youngest ones were around my age, five, six-year-old, seven-year-old, eight-year-old, and then there were girls about 15, 16, 18-year-old, and some older women, too. And what was the general mood about, how were people communicating with each other? No, really, because everybody was so traumatized. Everybody was thinking about their own family, that somebody would come and pick them up. They did tell a sort of tragic story to each other, what happened, the time they moved. They were taken. Yeah. From their homes and families. But that was out there, too. Otherwise, nobody knew. Do you remember any stories? No, I don't know. And do you remember the day that you were found by your relatives? Yeah. Can you describe that day? Yeah, my uncle came. And what happened, what they used to do was that they register, whenever a refugee came, they register on the names and family names and where they come from. So, uh... I'm trying to remember what you said. What? Did you say what you said? I don't know. I can't remember. I don't remember. I don't remember.
