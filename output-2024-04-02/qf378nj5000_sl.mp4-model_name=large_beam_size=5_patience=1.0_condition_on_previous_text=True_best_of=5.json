{"text": "My name is Elvira Prieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here. I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school. My name is Eva Silva, I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom. And I'm from Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado. I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano studies. I'm from a town in San Diego called Escondido, and um, what else, that's it for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna, I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education. And um, I'm from Burbank, California. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social studies high school teacher. Do you want to ask some questions here as to how this started, and how they evolved? In your own words, how did it start? How did this hunger strike start and why? How did it start? Speak to us as if we don't know. Okay. Speak to me and I can tell you something. Well I guess it was a buildup of a lot of different things. Yeah. build up of a lot of different things that have been happening not only on this campus but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States, the universities and everywhere else. So, you know, I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have happened, the closing down of the Office of Chicano Affairs and then with all the threats with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers and just these attacks on the theme houses on the ethnic centers and everything else and then the laying off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean, everything just like piled on, piled on and so many things were happening that we said, wait, we need to do something about it and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening. No fundamental change. that we want to happen. I'm tired, I'm sorry. Some people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this. Because the administration has been very, whenever we've had meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever, get togethers with any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with. And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing and just the way that people in that it was maybe the only way that they would, I don't know if it would touch their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it. Because otherwise they weren't paying attention. It was just like everything had to go business as usual. And there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down. It was way too much. It was what they said first and then if we could deal with that, if we as students could deal with what the university wanted, well then that was fine. And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because they earned it or whatever. Yeah, because meeting after meeting, you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time. It was just, okay, I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7, I'll give you a meeting from 5.30 to 6 or whatever. We've tried their methods. We've tried their methods of working things out and their methods are to draw things out for as long as possible in order to not give us things. At least, you know, they may say differently but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous to have to spend I'm sorry I'm slow but I'm a little bit tired. It's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and, you know, they're trying to tire us out. We're just talking. So that's what it had to come to and, you know, when people are not heard, you know, and this happens in society at large, when people are not heard, yeah, you know, I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors but, you know, behaviors that are not normal and, you know, behaviors that are not normal are what happen and, yeah, this is not normal. You know, this is not normal behavior for us to be, you know, not eating. Mm-hmm. But, you know. I really like to eat. Yeah, we like to eat. We love food. And, you know, it just, so I emphasize, you know, why are Chicanos in prison? Why are Chicanos, you know, in poverty? That's not normal. That's not normal for people. But because of society, that's how we are. And we've waited long enough for this. I mean, I know the administration is probably thinking, well, you know, be patient and these changes will happen. But we've been patient long enough and, you know, the Chicano studies major has been, was envisioned back in the 70s, even the 60s. And we've been waiting since then and it's about time that we get recognized, you know. Chicanos are the biggest, are coming to be a majority in California and, you know, maybe even in the whole country after a while. But, I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized and that other people, you know, that other people just realize that we're not going to go away. And if they don't educate themselves about us, then it's just going to be worse for them. Julia, you co-authored a really beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres. What, for you, is the significance of having four Chicanos taking the vanguard role in this movement, which is really bigger than this campus? For me? I mean... For you? I don't know. We didn't really realize it was four women until somebody pointed it out to us. I don't... I mean, we knew it was girls, but we didn't see it like, you know, oh, you know, there's no guys here and, you know, like, you know, what's up with the guys? But, I don't know. I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male. Maybe they didn't say they were going to go for the long run, but they've been, you know, there the whole time. Yeah. I mean, everybody has their roles, and it's, like, there's some people that are the negotiators. There's people that are security over here. There's, like, everybody has their roles, and, you know, we're not the most important, because if it wasn't for them, then, you know, nobody would be listening to us or whatever. And there's other people that have been fasting also, like, Felipe, do you know him? He's been fasting these three days with us as well, and, like, there's people that committed to three days and others that do one-day cycles to show their support and solidarity. It's true. There are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying, you know, like, with the rest of the women also, trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this, and they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need or what needs to be done for the whole group. And so it's, I don't know. I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that. Yeah, because I think... Because everybody really does have their own role, and everybody's been really supportive, and we're working together. It just so happened that we're the ones that, you know, we're the ones that, you know, were ready mentally at this time to fast. And, you know, it just so happens that we're all women. Yeah, people are calling us guerrilleras and revolucionaries. I mean, that's, I mean, that's fine. That's nice. You know, it's really, that's really nice, but... But, I mean, everybody, you know... Everybody's been revolutionary. And, you know, it comes down to, like... The focus should be on everybody. Yeah, it comes down to, like, what your, you know, I don't want to say your talents, because I don't think our talent is to be hungry, but... But pretty much, like, everybody has taken on the role that is best suited for themselves. Yeah. There you go. There's Felipe. There's Felipe. You know, of all the things that you could have done, of all the actions you could have taken, why fasting? Why did you choose to fast? Well, it's obviously a really strong statement. You know, it's something that, it's uncompromising, and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people way before us, you know, have fought for, and we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had, that vision they had, is fulfilled. We can't just, you know... It may be 20 years, 20, 30, 20 years later from the Chicano movement that people think is dead, but it's not dead. We're here, and we're living, and we're the Chicano movement. And Chicana movement. Yeah. Chicano, Chicana. Chicana movement. Felipe, you just joined us, but actually you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning, as was pointed out. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from, and your reflection on this struggle? Sure. My name is Felipe Barragan. I'm a freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California. This struggle, I think, for me, it's something that's very important because I went to high school in Watts, and a lot of people know what Watts is like. 1965, Watts Rebellion, the 92 riots. There I saw issues that the educational system for high school students and Chicanos, Latinos there, wasn't addressing the real issues. Once I came here, I got a taste of it. I got a taste of Chicano studies. I found out how crucial that was. And I think that getting involved with the struggle is important for me to build the processes with which we learn to deal with inner city, to wipe out the marginalization of our people. In terms of your actions, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study and that you should be in the classroom. Not, you know, protesting. And so you're making a decision. Because it is a pretty tough university to be at, and there's a lot of demands, and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance. How did you make that decision? See, I guess, like, the main thing is, is, like, I never... Like, when I came here, I didn't want to come and study and go to class and go back home, study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself. While there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools. There's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly. There's kids being born without hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on, because, you know, that's my people. That's my parents. That's my family. That's, you know, everybody. And I wouldn't be able to live with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight As and doing my resumes and stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done. You know, so, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it. Today we had, you know, little chicanitas and chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out and from a group called Traices de Mexico. And they came out and they're, you know, they came out and supported us. You know, they're just little kids. I don't know. They're probably, like, from five to, like, 12 maybe. And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or study hours or whatever is so that they, when they come here, you know, they can focus, you know, on doing the things that they need to do. Instead of having to struggle so much. I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know. They struggle so that we don't have to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we don't. We're still struggling, but at a different level. You know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry. Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about where am I going to get something to eat like before or how are we going to pay the bills. We're probably going to have to, you know, we're probably going to be able to pay even our parents' bills. Hopefully. Yeah. I think it also goes back to the question about why did we choose a hunger strike? It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this and we're not going to graduate with a great GPA, you know, as we could have. And, I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable of doing a work, but we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else because our issues are so important. And, I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that, but I don't know if anybody sees that. But, I mean, you know, I know that I could be an A student, you know, but, you know, I choose to better be like, to be a human being first and to care more about my people than about my grades. I was going to ask you, you know, related to the incident that happened on Sunday at the Flix, at the film Notary's show. How do you feel or what steps can the university take to educate the student community, even staff and faculty, about the issue of, you know, ongoing racism, the issue of why it's important to have abandoned graves on this campus? How do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community? I think if they really, truly believe that that isn't right, that the incident at Flix isn't right, or that people should know and should, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong, then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university. If they really feel responsible for the education of their students, if they really, if they believe that that is an important issue, that people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students finding that amusing, there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level or something of the students at this university, and they are responsible because they're the administrators. They're in charge of this school. They're here to serve the students, but they're also here to help educate them. And there's, I mean, to me that proved just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me, but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful. And if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it. I mean, the main things that were, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about, you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time. And, you know, one of them being a campus ban on grapes, the development of a Chicano studies program, and the community center in East Palo Alto. And, you know, these are things that we can talk about specifically. And the offer for Cecilia Bulciaga. And the offer for a high-level position for Cecilia Bulciaga, the high-level administrator here. Chicano administrator. Why is it important for the university to recognize Cecilia's contributions? Why is Cecilia's position and Cecilia's role included among these other three? Well, basically because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking, that our education isn't addressing the real issues. You know, the issues being poverty, the joblessness, and, you know, the over-representation we have in the jails, and just everything. And she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues. She's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Grapes Campaign. And, I mean, when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here, I mean, she's like... A role mother. A role model. A role mother. Oh, man, I'm getting tired. Oh, no, you're good. Yeah, what we're talking about, she's a role model and a role mother. Mother figure. Mother figure. That's it. Now, I guess, basically, because she helps, you know, just keeping us here, because it's hard to survive in a campus like this when you have people, like, Sunday nights at Flick saying, Beaners, go home, or, you know, saying stuff like that here at Stanford. I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us, that you have to justify your existence? And you need people like Cecilia Bustiaga and, like, Francis that just help you out just to make, like, especially the transition from, like, your first year, I mean, that's what helped me so much, living in Zapata my very first year, is, you know, I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think, because, I mean, she helped out a lot, like, with my parents and just everything. I mean, I think, like, they're always caring for you. She's an important contact for us. I mean, there's so few of us here, and then there's so few of our, you know, Chicano and Chicana role models here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know, this happened to me today. Or, you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home where I see a lot of people who look like myself, you know. And these are people that you can talk to, like Cecilia. You know, she's, I mean, I find it incredible. She always has time to hear us out, always. Yeah, when I was a freshman, like, I have a really nice story about her that when I, well, I didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year. And so, like, I had a lot of problems, like, just trying to adapt and trying to decide, like, what I was going to do with my life. And I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what I really wanted to do, which was to be a teacher. And my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me. And I remember going into her office and just, like, crying my guts out because I didn't know what, I didn't know where I fit into this university. And she talked, she had time. Like, she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what I felt was right. Yeah. You know, to let my heart decide. And, I mean, for the university not to recognize that she is capable of, like, keeping me here because I was ready to leave. And she literally made, helped me to stay. And if it wasn't for her, I mean, I wouldn't be here. All of you are members of MEDCHA, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanos. That's a long history. What is the significance of that? The significance of this new phase? And I'm referring specifically to the various events that started at UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Colorado, University of Colorado, and Michigan State. Virginia, too. Virginia, too. Can you talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence of MEDCHA and Chicano student activism? I think as MEDCHA is the Chicano student movement, and there's a long history of activism there, leading back to the original plan at Plano Santa Barbara. And I think that each of us has maintained that goal of the betterment of la raza. And our MEDCHA is very strong, and we support what those founding MEDCHistas came up with in terms of the Plano Santa Barbara. And in UCLA and UC Santa Barbara and other universities, MEDCHA members and other organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands. I think it's playing an instrumental role. They got misquoted? Are they in support? Yeah. So what happened? They're going to print it. They're going to print it tomorrow. That sucks, man. Okay. I feel bad for lying about it. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I was going to ask you. I know earlier I talked to your dad, and I talked to your mom. I know from them that it's been really hard for them. I mean, they haven't been eating as well. They're also, in a way, also in the hunger strike. How do you feel about that? How do you feel about that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow, that doubled it. How do you feel about your parents' role in this? How are you going to explain it to your parents once it's over and you haven't already explained it to your parents? Well, I told them ... My biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in The Fast was how my mom was going to take it because I thought she was going to get ... She's an asthmatic, and I thought she was going to get sick because any time she stresses out she has really bad attacks and stuff. and stuff and i just i just knew i was going to worry her and i was going to hurt her and that was the thing that scared me the most but i talked to her about it and i kind of eased her into it i started telling her first about the plan to stay out of the quarter and stuff like that and she was like well she told me um before i even mentioned to her that i was going to fast she said well when you are leading when you are a leader and you are want to take part in changing things when they're bad sometimes you have to make sacrifices she said and you know whatever happens you guys you know you have my prayers and you have my support and so then when i told her she was like oh and i guess she maybe understood or was getting you know thought that i was going to get to that because i told him she was like well she said i'm not going to tell you to do it and i'm not going to tell you not to do it because i don't want i don't want to feel responsible for you doing it and i don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe you know it didn't succeed or because you weren't you know you really didn't want to do what you wanted to she said but i'm really scared but um she said that she had faith in god and as long as i had faith in god that everything would be okay and she said i'm not going to do what i wanted to everything was going to be okay. And so for me it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone I decided, I really felt strongly about it already and I decided that this was something I was going to do. And even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain, that I was going to get through it and that she was going to get through it. And I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either. And I haven't been able to speak with her since that last time I talked to her. But like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already past her youth and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore and she said it's our turn. And so here we are, we're trying to make changes because I don't want to, I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this. And I have a younger sister who's here also and I don't want her to have to, you know, continue this. I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here but, you know, if I could, if I can help out in some way. So that, you know, the kids that come here later don't have to be going through this then that would be awesome. So, yeah. I have a question. How has the university administration... Okay. Can I go? Yeah. Okay. I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well. It's like, I knew, like when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it. I wanted to be part of the hunger strike. I just knew that I could do it. And I wanted to do it. And I was gonna have the willpower to go through with it but the only thing was my mom. I didn't know how to tell her. I didn't know what to tell her. I was scared because I know that the way my mom is, she worries and she doesn't sleep that night and she can't eat and it's just, it's bad. I hate it. I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything but, I don't know, it's just something I felt so deep for myself. I just thought, you know, so many people are gonna gain a lot from this. So many people are gonna, you know, have a lot of things come out of this especially like with the East Palo Alto Community Center and with the boycott on the graves. It's just immediate like help for people that are practically, that are dying and, you know, being born with birth defects. So when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it. She was telling me I'm anemic, that I was anemic and my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count and they're just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing it because I was so skinny and I was gonna disappear and this and that. So then, um, oh, sorry. So then, um, after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard. She was crying and everything and then I called her after the first day of the hunger strike. Um, and she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone. So that, that was just made me, I was just crying. I was talking to my sister and my sister was, you know, I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry. Tell her that I'm feeling good. The issues are keeping me alive and they're gonna keep me alive and I'm gonna be okay. So, um, but she's gonna come today because she's, she's worried and she wants to see me. Well, uh, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, you know, just to, you know, to, to tell my mom and dad, you know, that I was gonna do this because like we've all said, you know, we don't want to make them suffer. But I, I told her and she said, um, you know, okay, well, if you guys are still out there after three days then I'm gonna come out. And then the right, like, a few minutes before I, I left, I was talking to her, y me estaba dando la bendición. Do I have to translate that? Oh, okay. And then, um, and then, um, so, you know, she, she, she, she, she, she, she, she, she, she was crying and I could tell and she was giving me la bendición and so she was like, you know what, I'm gonna be out there tomorrow and stuff and, you know, my mom and dad got some money together and then so my mom could fly out here and stuff. And um, so she, she came out last night and I mean, I think it was better for her to come because she, you know, she was upset when she saw me and she was crying and stuff but, you know, she's been really good and everybody's been really supportive of her and she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful. To this, to this thing, she feels a part of, a part of this strike and, you know, she feels a part of the movement and, you know, I think that, you know, she is because, you know, we're fighting, I'm fighting for her and for everybody and, um, you know, she slept out there with us last night so, she's hardcore. Um, for me, that, that was definitely the hardest part because, and after I did it, I was, I wished that I didn't, that I didn't have to but I knew that I was going to be able to do it. I know that I, that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her if she had found out some other way so, um, I'm just really worried about her because she has heart problems and, um, I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something, you know, you know, everything would be worse but, but, you know, she's fine and, and she already told me that she supports me and, and even though it's the, the hardest thing, you know, for her. You know, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight and maybe that, hopefully that made her feel a little bit better but maybe, hopefully, I don't know, I don't know exactly how she is. Last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak and, um, my dad called me like the next morning, the morning after I told my mom and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it. He told me all kinds of things and he told me, why do you want to, why do you want to go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers in your life and just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through just to get where I am and trying to tell me, well, don't, you know, don't do it but I still did it and he's here right now and he came and told me, he's still trying to convince me to stop because he goes, he says, if you know, your mom's going to come up here tomorrow and if you're still on the strike, she's going to strike with you so, I don't know. Um, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um, I think generally my parents, um, have the same feelings as all of theirs do, um, but it's a little bit easier for them to handle because tonight's going to be my last day of fasting so, that's basically it. Last word? Um, well, okay. You said it's for historical purposes, right? So when, um, you know, 20 years from now when other Chicanos look at this, you know, we In Chicanos. In Chicanos. Sorry. Yeah. I'm tired. Um, you know, one other hint to see this, um, just to remember that, you know, even when you're looking at this now, 20 years later, the movement is still alive in you and we still have to keep struggling because, you know. Well, hopefully we can stop. Hopefully we can stop some of it. But I mean, if it's still, if it's still bad, you know, for 20 years from now, you know, we can do it, you know. Yeah. It's awesome. And don't take advantage of what. Of what? Of what you have. I guess, like, like for us it's very important to, to say, oh, we have, we have el centro and there's a lot of people that worked hard for it. Don't settle for what you have. Don't settle for what you have. And don't forget us pretty much. Don't forget. The people who fought before you. All, all the things, like the people that fought before us and. And before us. And before them and just remember we're, you know, we're doing this for you, for, for the future. For the youth. I feel like we're just partying right now. Thank you. My name is this. Okay. The new message is this. It is currently about 7.30 on the 6th of May, Friday, 1994. We have just collected, witnessed the five testimonials from five of the hunger strikers which have included at one point over 100 Solidarity strikers. At this time, we have received the latest response from the administration which has been recalcitrant up to this point. I understand that there are still many points that need to be reviewed and some more dialogue that needs to take place, but at the moment, it looks as though the statement that we have made as a community, the Chicano community, and the statement that comes from various communities throughout the Bay Area and the nation in solidarity with us. Thank you. That statement has begun to open the administration's eyes to the justness of our cause and our demands. However, as I said, there still is some work to be done. For the moment, it seems as though our first demand, that is the offering of a high level position to Associate Dean Cecilia Burciaga, is still not being met. And as I said, this is our first demand and it is very important to us. Some more negotiation has to go on with regards to that. The second demand involves the establishment of a community center in East Palo Alto to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university. And as far as the university's administration is concerned, they are receiving a lot of support. Thank you. I believe that they are receptive to the initiatives of the Chicano-Chicanos students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy. This has been a very important component to the struggle here. As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new. It goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara, which inaugurated MEHTCHA. So we are very hopeful that some breakthrough will come through here. come through here. As regards to the Chicano and Chicana studies, again, this is the justness and the feasibility of this demand has led the administration to also give overtures that are encouraging. Finally, the issue of grapes on campus has, and specifically the negative reactions, the racist reactions to our efforts to educate the community at Stanford has, and our protests, our protests against those negative reactions has led the university to embark upon an initiative to educate all the dorms through the showing of the no grapes video and also through establishing a dialogue with our community, the Chicano community, in an effort to bridge the gaps that have been established. To bridge the divisions that have been caused by the racism that's very often a result of an academy which is very hierarchical and one which is institutionally and structurally hostile to the presence of minorities and other marginalized people. With this, I would just like to say, Que Viva La Raza y Adelante. We're going to win this one. Thank you very much. And I just have to say, thank you for all the Отмなんか.
