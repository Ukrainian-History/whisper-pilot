{"language": "en-US", "transcript": "That's right. My name is Vira Fto. I'm a sophomore um in human biology here. I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school. Um My name is Eva Silva. I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom and I'm from Salinas, California and I'm gonna be a math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado and I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano studies. I'm from uh a town in San Diego called Escondido. And um what else? That's it for now? Yep. My name is Julio Gonzalez Luna. I am a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education and um I'm from um Burbank California and I'm gonna be a, a social studies um high school teacher. Ok. We wanna ask some questions here as to how this started and in your own words, how did it start? How, how did this hunger strike start and why? Yeah. How did it start? Ok. Well, I guess it was a build up of a lot of um different things that have been happening, not only on this campus but overall in this nation, with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States in the universities and everywhere else. So, um, you know, I, I guess I can run down, like, since my freshman year, so many things have happened, the closing down of the Chi Office of Chicano Affairs. And then, um with all the threats with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers and just these attacks on the theme houses on the ethnic centers and everything else. And then the uh laying off of Cecilia BSA, I mean, everything just like piled down, piled down. And so many things were happening that we said, wait, we need to do something about it and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening that we wanna happen. I'm tired. I'm always, people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this. Uh Some people say, why do you? Because the administration has been very and when, whenever we've had like meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever, we get togethers with um any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with. And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme um things are outside in terms of immigrant bashing and, and just the way the people in is Palo Alto are that it was maybe the only way that they would, that it would, I don't know if it would touch their heart or if they would just stop to think about it or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it because otherwise they weren't paying attention. It was just like everything had to go business as usual. And there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down. It was what they said first. And then if we could deal with that, if we, as students could deal with, excuse me, what the university wanted, well, then that was fine. And if we couldn't, that's too bad because they're at their position because, you know, they earned it or whatever. Yeah, because meeting after meeting, like you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time. It was just ok, I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7, I'll give you a meeting from 530 to 6 or whatever. And we've tried their methods, we've tried their methods of um working things out and their methods are to draw things out for as long as possible in order to not give us things. And at least, you know, they may say it differently, but that's what it feels like. And it's ridiculous to have to spend um I'm sorry, I'm slow but a little bit tired. Um, it's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and, you know, they're trying to tire us out with just talking. So that's what it had to come to and, you know, when people are not heard, you know, and this happens in society at large when people are not heard. Yeah. You know, I, I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors but, you know, behaviors that are not normal, you know, behaviors that are not normal are, are what happened. And yeah, this is not normal, you know, this is not normal behavior for us to be, you know, not eating but, but, you know, yeah, we like to eat and, um, you know, it just emphasize, you know, why are Chicanos in prison? Why are Chicanos, you know, in poverty? That's not normal, that's not normal for people. But because of society, that's how we are and we've waited long enough for this. I mean, I know the administration is probably thinking, well, you know, be patient and these changes will happen, but we've been patient long enough and, you know, the Chicano studies major has been, it was envisioned back in, back in the seventies, even the sixties. And, and we've been waiting since then and it's about time that, that we get recognized, you know, Chicanos are, are the biggest, are ma are coming to be a majority in California and, you know, maybe even in the whole country after a while. But I mean, it's about time that our issues get recognized and that, that other people just, just realize that we're not gonna go away and if they don't educate themselves about us, then it's just gonna be worse for them. Well, yeah, you co-authored a really beautiful poem, the title. So my head, what for you is the significance of having before Chicanas taking the vanguard role in this, this movement, which is really bigger than this canvas for me. I mean, I don't know, we didn't really realize it was four women till somebody pointed it out to us. I don't, I mean, we knew it was girls but we didn't see it like, you know, oh, you know, there's no guys here and you know, like, you know what's up with the guys. But um I don't know, I mean, we have a lot of supporters that are male and maybe they didn't say they're gonna go for the long run, but they've been, you know, there the whole time everybody like has, has, has their roles and it's like there's some people that are the negotiators, there's people that are security over here, there's like everybody has their roles and you know, we're, we're not the, the most important because if it wasn't for them, then, you know, nobody would be listening to us or whatever. And there's other people that have been fasting also like Felipe se you know, bar again, he's been fasting these three days with us as well. And like there's people that committed to three days and others that do 11 day cycles to show their support and solidarity. It's true. There are, there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying, you know, like with the rest of the women also trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this and they're just constantly looking out to see what, you know, what we need or what needs to be done for the whole group. And so it's, I don't know, I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that because I think because everybody, everybody really does have their own role and everybody's been really supportive and we're working together. It's really, it just so happened that we were the ones that it was that, um, you know, we're the ones that, that, you know, we're ready mentally at this time too, too fast. And, um, you know, it just so happens that we're all women. Yeah, people are calling us guerrillas and revolution and all that. I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's fine. That's, thats really nice. But, but I mean, everybody, everybody's been revolutionary and, you know, it's like everybody, yeah, it comes down to like what you, you know, I don't want to say your talent because I don't think our time is to be hungry. But, but pretty much like everybody has taken on the role that, that is best suited for themselves. And on this, there's Felipe, you know, of all the things that you could have done, of all the actions you could have taken. Why fasting? Why did you choose to France? Well, it's obviously a really strong statement. You know, it's something that it's uncompromising and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers and people way before us and you know, have, have fought for and we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had, those, that vision they had is fulfilled. We can't just, you know, it may be 20 years, 2030 2020 years later from the, you know, the Chicano movement that people think is dead but it's not dead. We're here and we're living and we're the Chicano movement and Chicana moment. Yeah, Chicano, Chicana, Chicano Felipe. Um you just joined us, but actually, you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning as, as was pointed out. Uh Can you tell us a little bit about yourself where you're from and, and your reflection on this struggle? Sure. Um My name is Felipe Baran. I'm a freshman originally from um Los Angeles, California. Um This struggle, I think for me, it's something that's very important because um I went to high school in Watts and a lot of people know what Watts is like 1965 Watts rebellion, the 92 riots there, I saw issues that, that the educational system for high school students of Chicano Latinos, there wasn't addressing the real issues. Once I came here, I got a, I got a taste of it if I can have a taste of Chicano studies and I found out how crucial that was. Um And I think that um getting involved with the struggle is important for me to, to build the uh the processes with which we learn to deal with inner city to wipe out the um marginalization of our people. Yeah, in terms of um your actions, you know, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study and that you should be in the classroom, not protesting. And so you're making the decision because it is, it is a pretty tough university to be at and there's a lot of demands and you kind of out there really taking a big chance. How, you know, how did you make that decision? See, I guess like the main thing is, is like, I never like when I, when I came here I didn't wanna come and just study and go to class and go back home study, do my work and just concentrate on myself while there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools. There's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly. There's kids being born with that hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on because, you know, that, that's, that's my people, that's my parents, that's my family, that's, you know, everybody and I wouldn't be able to live with, with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done and, you know, so, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford Chicanos and Chicanos don't have to do it today. We had, you know, little Chicanas and Chicanos from East Palo Alto come out and from Avala Fron group called Tres in Mexico. And they came out and they were, you know, they came out and supported us, you know, they're just little kids, you know, I don't know, they're probably like from five to like 12 maybe. And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or study hours or whatever. Um, you saw that they, when they come here, you know, you know, they can focus, you know, and on doing the things that they need to do instead of having to struggle so much. I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know, they struggle so that we don't have to struggle and we don't, I mean, we don't, we're still struggling but at a different level, you know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry once we get out of here, we're not gonna have to worry about where am I gonna get something to eat like before, or how are we gonna pay the bills? We're probably gonna have to, you know, we're probably gonna be able to pay even our parents bills. Yeah. But I think it also goes back to the question about where, why did we choose a hunger strike? It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are gonna suffer from this and we're not gonna graduate with a great GPA, you know, that as we could have. And I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable of doing a work but we feel so strongly about this, that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else because our issues are so important. And I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that but I don't know if anybody says that. But, but I mean, you know, I, I know that I, I could be a nice student, you know, and, but I, you know, I choose, I choose to, I better be like to be a human being first and to care more about my people than about my grades. I also ask you related to um the incident that happened on Sunday at the, at the, at the, on the film uh military film. Uh ho how do you, how do you feel or, or, or what steps can the university take uh to educate the student, the student community in a staff and faculty about the uh the issue of, of, you know, ongoing racism that the issue of why it's important to have abandoned grapes on this campus? Uh How, how do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community? I think if um if they really truly believe that that isn't right that the internet at Flix isn't right or that people should know and should be, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong, then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university. If they really feel responsible for the education of their students, if they really, if they believe that that is an important issue that people's lives and people's house and the reaction of some of some or a lot of students, um finding that amusing, there's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level or something of the students at this university and they are responsible because they're the administrators, they're in charge of the school. They're here to serve students and, but they're also here to help educate them. And there's, I mean, to me that proved just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me and, but it was very offensive and it was very disrespectful and if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it. I mean, the main things that were, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about. Um you know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time. And um you know, one of them being a, a campus band on grapes, um the development of a Chicano studies program and the community center in is Palo Alto and, you know, these are things that we can talk about specifically and uh offered for Cecilia and they offer for a high level position for Cecilia B, a high level administrator here to become an administrator. Why, why is it important to, to for the, for the university to recognize uh Cecilia's contributions zone? Why, why Cecilia's positions that he just wrote included among these other three? Well, basically because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking that our education isn't addressing the real issues, you know, the issues being in poverty, the job, joblessness. And um you know, the overrepresentation we have in the jails and just everything and she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues. She's always, you know, she was working on the, um, boycott Grapes campaign and, I mean, and when she gets here, I mean, when she's here you get here. I mean, she, she's like, um, a role model. Role model. Ok. Oh, man. Getting tired. Um, oh, no. Yeah, we're talking about, she's a, she's a role model and a role mother. She had a figure. No, I guess basically because she helps in just keeping us here because it's hard to survive in a campus like this when you have people like Sunday nights at flick saying *** go home or, you know, saying stuff like that here at Stanford. I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us that you have to justify your existence and you, you need people like Cecilia bagga and like Francis that just help you out just to make, like, especially the transition from like, your first year. I mean, that's what helped me so much living in Zapata. My very first year is, you know, I survived the whole year because I was living there, I think because, I mean, she, she helped out a lot with my parents and just everything. I mean, I think like, they always carry, she's an important, important contact for us. I mean, there's so ma so few of us here and then there's so few of our, you know, Chicano and Chicana role models here that we can, you know, talk to and say, you know, hey, you know, this happened to me today or, you know, I really, it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home where I see a lot of people who look like myself, you know, and these are people that you can talk to like, Cecilia, you know, she's, she's in, I mean, I, I find it incredible. She's always has time to hear us out. Always. Yeah, when, um, when I was a freshman, like I, I have a really nice story about her that um when I, well, I didn't, for some dumb chance, I didn't get to live in Zapata my freshman year. And so, so like I had a lot of problems, like, just trying to adapt and trying to, trying to decide like what I was gonna do with my life. And I had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what I really want to do is to be a teacher. And um um my advise, my freshman advisor recommended that I go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me. And I remember going into her office and just like crying my guts out because I didn't know what, I didn't know where I fit into this university. And um she taught, she had time, like, she, she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what, what I felt was right. You know, that to let my heart decide. And I mean, for the university not to recognize that she is capable of like keeping me here because I was ready to leave. And she, she literally made me, helped me to stay. And if it wasn't for her, I mean, I, I wouldn't be here. Um All of you are members of dementia. Well, student PG has lung has lung history. What, what if, what is um the significance of this new phase? And, and, and I'm referring specifically to, to the, the, the various uh the events that started uh uclauc Santa Barbara Colorado, University of Colorado and Michigan State, Virginia and Virginia too. You talk about this in the context of the overall resurgence of mea and she comes to an activism. Um I think as me is the, the Chicano student movement and there's a long history of activism there dating back to the original Planet band, the Santa Adora. And I think that each of us has, has um maintained that I, that I um that goal of the betterment of La Raza. And um our mea is, is very strong and we support with those founding uh Machista um came up with in terms of the and um it's gaining, it's in UCL A and UC Santa Barbara and other universities. Me, me, a members and other um organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands. I think it's playing instrumental role. They got misquoted. Are they in support? Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry. I, I was gonna ask you, I know um earlier I talked to, you know, your dad and I talked to your mom and I know from them that but it's been really hard for them. I mean, they haven't been eating as well and they, they also in a way also in, in the hunger strike of you. How, how, how do you feel about your parents role in this? How, um how are you, how are you gonna explain it to your parents once it's over? You haven't really extended to uh what hers, that kind. Um When I, well, I told my, my, my biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the fast was how my mom was gonna take it because I thought she was gonna, you know, get, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was gonna get sick because any, anytime she stresses out she has really bad attacks and stuff and I just, I just knew I was gonna worry her and I was gonna hurt her and that was the thing that scared me the most, but I talked to her about it and I kind of eased her into it. I started telling her first about the plan to stay out in the quad and stuff like that. And she was like, well, she told me, um, before I even mentioned to her that I was gonna fight, she said, well, Miha, when you are leading, when you are a leader and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. She said, and you know, whatever happens, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support. And so then when I told her she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was, you know, thought that I was gonna get to that because I told her and she was like, well, she said, I'm not gonna tell you to do it and I'm not gonna tell you not to do it because I don't want, I don't wanna feel responsible for you doing it and I don't wanna be, feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe it, you know, it didn't succeed or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want to do what you wanted to. She said, but I'm really scared. But um she said that she had faith in God. And as long as I had faith in God that everything was gonna be ok. And so for me, it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone, I decided I, this is, I really felt strongly about it already and I decided that this was something I was gonna do. And even though I was gonna, cause her a lot of pain that I was gonna get through it and that she was gonna get through it. And I'm, I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either and I haven't been able to speak with her since, since that last time I talked to her. But, um, but like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already passed her use and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore. And she said it's our turn. And so here we are, we're trying to make changes because I don't wanna, I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this. And I, I have a younger sister who's here also and I don't want her to have to, you know, continue this. But I mean, I'm, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here. But, you know, if I could, if I can help out in some way so that, you know, the kids that come here later don't have to be going through this and that would be awesome. So, yeah, the final question, how has the university administration? Ok. Ok. And I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well. It's like I al I knew, like, when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it. I wanted to be part of the hunger strike. I, I just knew that I could do it and I, I was gonna have the willpower to go through with it. But the only thing was my mom, I didn't know, I didn't know how to tell her. I didn't know what to tell her. I was scared because I know that the way my mom is, she worries and she doesn't sleep that night and she can't eat and it's just, it's bad. I hate it. I don't, I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything. But um I don't know, it's just something I felt so, so deep from my heart. I just thought, you know, so many people are gonna gain a lot from this. So many people are gonna, you know, have a lot of things come out of this, especially like with the is Pado at the community center and with the, the boycott on the graves, it's just immediate like help for, for people that are practically that are dying and you know, being born with birth defects. So, um when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it. She was telling me I'm anemic that I was anemic then my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count and they're just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing it because I was so skinny and I was gonna disappear and this and that. So then, um, oh, sorry. So then, um, after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard, she was crying and everything and, and then I called her after the first day of the, of the hunger strike and she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone. So that, that was just made me, I was just crying. I was talking to my sister and my sisters, you know, I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry, tell her that I'm feeling good. The issues are keeping me alive and they're gonna keep me alive and I'm gonna be ok. So, um, but she's gonna come today because she's, she's worried and she wants to see me. Hm. Hm. Well, uh, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, to tell my mom and dad, you know that I was gonna do this because like we've all said, you know, we don't wanna make them suffer. But, uh, I told her and she said, um, you know, ok, well, if you guys are still out there after three days and I'm gonna come out and then the right like a few minutes before I, I left, I was talking to her and no la do I have to translate that? Oh, ok. And then, um, and then, um, so, you know, she was, she was crying and I could tell and she was giving me the vic and so she was like, you know what, I'm gonna be up there tomorrow and stuff and, you know, my mom and dad got some money together and then so my mom could fly out here and stuff. And, um, so she, she came out last night and I mean, I think it was better for her to come because she, you know, she was upset when she saw me, she was crying and stuff. But, you know, she's been really good and everybody's been really supportive of her and she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful to this, to this thing. She feels a part of a part of this strike and, you know, she feels a part of the movement and, you know, I think that, you know, she is because, you know, we're fighting or fighting for her and for everybody and, um, you know, she slept out there with us last night so she's hard core. Um, for me, that, that was definitely the hardest part because, and after I did it, I was, I wish that I didn't, that I didn't have to. But I know that I, that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her if she had found out some other way. So, um, I'm just really worried about it because she has heart problems and, um, I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something, you know, and, you know, we send that everything would be worse. But, but, you know, she's fine and, and she already told me that she supports me and, and even though it's the, the hardest thing, you know, for her, like she know, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight. And maybe that, hopefully, that made her feel a little bit better. But maybe, hopefully, I don't know. I don't know exactly how she is. Uh, last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak. And, um, my dad called me like the next morning, the morning after I told my mom and he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it. He, he told me all kinds of things and he told me, why do you want, why do you wanna go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers in your life? And just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through just to get where I am and trying to tell me, well, don't, you know, don't do it, but I still did it and he's here right now and he came and told me he's still trying to convince me to stop because he goes, he says if you know, your mom is gonna come up here tomorrow and if you're still on the strike, she's gonna strike with you. So, I, um, I think generally my parents, um, have the same feelings as all, all of theirs do. Um, but it's a little bit easier for them to handle because tonight's gonna be my last day if I was to. So that's basically it, last word, you know. Um, well, ok, you said it's for historical purposes, right? So when, um, you know, 20 years from now, when other Chicanos look at this, you know, and Chicanas and Chicanos, sorry, tired of, you know, when others had to see this. Um, just to remember that, you know, even when you're looking at this now, 20 years later, the movement is still alive in you and we still have to keep struggling because, you know, well, hopefully we can, hopefully we can stop some of it. But I mean, if it's still, if it's still bad, you know, for 40 years from now, you know, we can do it, you know, and don't take advantage of what, you know, what you have, I guess, like, like for us it's very important to, to say, oh, we have, we have El Centro and there's a lot of people that worked hard for what you don't settle for what you have and don't forget us pretty much. Don't forget the people who fought before you all, all the things like the people that fought before us and, and before this and before them and just remember we're, you know, we're doing this for you for, for the future. You like what you, my my name is the, the, the the it is currently about 730 on the sixth of May Friday. Um 1994 we have just uh collected uh witnessed the five testimonials from, from uh five of the of, of the hunger strikers which have included um at one point over 100 solidarity strikers. Um At this time, we received the latest response from the administration which has been recalcitrant up to this point. And uh I understand that there's still many points that need to be go ne need to be reviewed and uh some more dialogue that needs to be, that needs to take place. But at the moment, it looks as though the statement that, that we have made as a community, the Chicano community and the statement that comes from various communities throughout the Bay area and the nation in solidarity with us um has open or begun to open the administration's eyes to the justness of our cause and our demands. Um However, um as I said, there still is some work to be done for the moment. It seems as though uh our first demand that is the the offering of a high level position to associate Dean Cecile Busa is still not being met. And uh as I said, this is our first demand and it's very important to us. Uh more negotiation has to uh go on with, with regards to that the second demand in involves the establishment of a community center in East Palo Alto to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university. And as, as um as far as the university administra, uh the administration is concerned uh they are receptive to the initiative that the Chicano students, Chicano Chicano students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy. Um uh This is, has been a very important component to the struggle here. Uh As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new, it goes all the way back to the plan de Santa Barbara which uh uh inaugurated Metra. So we are, we, we are very hopeful that some, some breakthrough will come through here as regards to Chicano and Chicano studies. Um again, uh this is uh the justness and, and the feasibility of this demand um has led the administration to also give overtures that um uh are are encouraging.
