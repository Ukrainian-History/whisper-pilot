{"text": "okay so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions that'll help me better understand the journey so you were talking about when the gunman took you with him do you remember what that journey was like and what you saw along the way oh not really much because all we were traveling and I was always wondering what's going to happen to me and where he's taking me he didn't explain to me anything so we used to at night we used to spend in a village along the way and where we get food and everything and rested and then start another day so that's how I remember going through the fields you know that was so you walked through fields all day yeah and then um what about eating during the day where did you eat oh we pick up the food from the village along the way so we eat we rested during the day in hot weather under the trees or somewhere so we ate whatever we got there he got I didn't know but he was getting food from somewhere you know from the village along the way so that's where we spent the day and what were the people like in the villages along the way oh they were I don't know what story he was telling them so I didn't know much about it but they were okay were there other children that you saw no and then when you went into your new family um how was that how many family members did they have there were two children two boys husband wife and husband's older brother they were all together about five of them yeah their older son was about 16 15 16 the younger one was about my age what was the typical day like um with that family to go out in the village in the farm help there where I could yes I every day I used to go to the farm yeah so whatever I could do I built away did their children also go to the farm yes and what about school no school none of you guys went to school I don't really know did anyone come to teach at home no what are the memories that you have from living in that family anything that really sticks out to you oh only stick out to me is that I was treated well I was given the same food what they were eating so but still I was not comfortable because I knew that I was not one of them and I had my family which I don't have anymore so I just resolved to my life whatever was there available to me so that was it very frustrating I was so quiet I was not having any fun anywhere I was just cut to myself did you play with any other children no I would come home and stay home because mostly I was scared because I was so fresh what happened to me and my family so so not much I could do and did they know your real name at any point yes that did yes they didn't know they knew my name they knew my village where I come from and all that yes how do they know all that the guy told him how did the guy know because he asked me when I took where he took with me along the way he asked me my name and my family and all sort of things you know and my father who I was and what happened to him and all that yeah I told him everything do you remember anything about your family he did not act like aundity famous to us I don't know he's the same people with a knew you that I heard that across the land a few people from my area always asked me where were you went gonna go away with dad and one man white uncle and I really thought you make me I'm gonna let others ask you who was that guy what's going on you have remember the name or did you in any way hear the name of the person who took you and so when they came to find you uh did you have any idea what was going on yeah i know because what happened with this there was some incident when they were military went to recover girls and boy they used to hide them so they couldn't find them so and they didn't have enough time to look around so they came first time they came during the day and uh i was not there i was in the fields so they told them he's not here so they went back they didn't ask any question where he was so then the guy who told them who i was and they went to him they said that we couldn't find the that boy there and because my cousin was my father's cousin were involved he wanted to find me so he went to that about my me living there so um he uh he said go at night i will be there at that time at night so they came and i had about 9 30 10 o'clock so one person knocked the door and they didn't know who was as soon as the door opened there was boot sounds of boots and a lot of people were talking each other so then all of a sudden one of them said where is the muslim boy so i was upstairs with the their one of their son sleeping upstairs so they came upstairs and they asked who's the muslim boy so i stood up then they brought me downstairs and i was crying i was nowhere what was going on so i was so scared i didn't want to go with him so then one of the soldier told my uncle's cousin who was there they told him to take it me on one side and tell tell me all my background my family so then i will be more calm and go with them so he took me on one side and told me about my father's name and my uncle's names and about the village and all that so then i was kind of satisfied that he's he knows the family so he'll be okay to go with so i went with him to the to ludhiana yeah there was a lot of uh because i had a long hair at that time and i had simple clothes so he went took me to the barber cut my hair and bought new clothes for me so then i would live there for two weeks after then i was transferred to pakistan on the hall here in the fuji camp and where did you live in ludhiana oh i don't remember it was where the soldiers were living they had a one area reserved for the all the refugees who they recovered they used to stay there until the bus was ready bus load was ready to transfer to pakistan and you know about the first time when they came to look for you who told you that story how did you find out about because when i came home in the evening at that time the family talked about it oh and what did you think when you heard them no i didn't know i as i said you know i was young to know who they were and what they were looking why they're looking for me and because i went to that tragedy what happened so i was scared anyway i was not sure where somebody would take me and who they are and where they're coming from why they're looking for me nothing at all and how did you find out that it was one of the boys from that family who had tipped off that after that my father's cousin he told me after that when he recovered me and he told me that's where he found me that that boy came and told them where i was and who i was and all that so can you describe the journey to the refugee camp who were the people that were with you uh how did you get there i uh when they put us on the bus i didn't know anybody in the bus i didn't out anywhere and my father's cousin couldn't come with us because he was in the military so he got to stay there so he wrote a letter to my his cousin my uncle that I was found and I will be in Fuji camp but because of the mail so slow they couldn't get it for two months the letter so by the time they got the letter in the meantime my mother's brother came and picked me up from there and took me with him to his house in Kasur can you describe the refugee camp it was a huge it was used to be jail before with the high walls and big huge courtyard and they emptied the jail and made it Fuji camp in Lahore and on jail road is used to call jail order that time that road so that that's where it was so where did you sleep and what did you eat I would sleep on the floor and there was food provided both time morning and evening and that's where was the Fuji camp I myself was looking in the Fuji camp that I could find some family members I could find anybody so I resolved myself well I don't know what's going to happen now I was just staying there every day did you talk to anyone no nobody talked to me I didn't talk to anybody as well what were the people like from your observation Oh everybody was terribly frightened and confused because all the people over there they have lost their family contact and everything they didn't know where their families were all the girls and whatever boys or young girls or older girls whoever they were they just stayed there all the days so nobody knew what to do or not to do and they were waiting for their relatives to come there and find them that was the only way there was no contact whatsoever and nobody knew who survived who didn't and I didn't know myself that how many family member or my cousin uncles or anybody cousins who survived who didn't I didn't know at that time what were the general ages of the people you think the youngest one were around my age 5 6 year old 7 year old 8 year old and then there were girls about 15 16 18 year old and some older women too and what was the general mood about how are people communicating with each other not really because everybody was so traumatized everybody was thinking about their own family own that somebody would come and pick them up they did tell you the sort of tragic story to each other what happened the time they moved they were taken from their homes and families but that was out there to it otherwise nobody knew do you remember any stories no I don't know and do you remember the day that you were found yeah my uncle came and what happened what they used to do was that they deserve whenever a refugee came they're just wrong on the on the names and family names and where they come from so", "segments": [{"id": 0,
