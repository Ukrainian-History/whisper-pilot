{"language": "en-IN", "transcript": "OK, so I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. Um, that'll help me. Better understand the journey. So you were talking about, uh, when the gunman took you with him? Uh, do you remember what that journey was like And what you saw along the way? Oh, not really much because all we were travelling and I was always wondering what's going to happen to me and where he's taking me. He didn't explain to me anything, so we used to, uh, at night we used to spend in a village along the way and, uh, where we get food and everything and rested and then start another day. So that's all I remember going through the, uh, fields, you know, you walk through fields all day? Yeah. And then what about eating during the day? Where did you eat? We pick up the food from the village along the way. So we rested during the day in hot weather under the trees or something. So we hate whatever we got there. He got I didn't know, but he was getting food from somewhere from the village along the way so that we spend the day and what were the people, like in the villages along the way? Oh, they were, uh I don't know what story he was telling them, so I didn't know much about it, but, uh, they were OK. Were there other Children that you saw? No. And then when you went into your new family, um, how was that? How many family members did they have? There were two Children. Two boys, husband and wife and husband's older brother. They were all together. About five of them. Yeah, The older son was about 1615, 16. The younger one was about my age. Yeah. What was a typical day? Like, um, with that family? Uh, I used to go out in the village, in the farm. Help there where we could Yes, I Every day, I used to go to the farm. Yeah, so whatever I could do, I will do it. Did their Children also go to the farm? Yes. And what about school? No school. None of you guys went to school. I not really No. Did anyone come to teach at home? No. What are the memories that you have from, uh, living in that family? Anything that really sticks out to you that you only stick out Stick out to me is that I was treated well. I was given the same food, what they were eating. So, uh, but still, I was not comfortable, cause, uh, I knew that I was not one of them. And I had my family, which I don't have anymore. So I just resolved to my life whatever was there available to me. So that was it. Very frustrating. Very, uh, I was so quiet. Uh, I was not, uh uh Do having any fun anywhere. I was just, uh, kept to myself. Did you play with any of their Children? I would come home and stay home because mostly I was scared because I was so fresh. What happened to me and my family, So not much I could do. And did they know your real name at any point? Yes, they did, Yes. They didn't know they knew my name. They knew my village where I come from and all that. Yes. How did they know all that? The guy told him because he asked me, uh, when I I took. He took with me along the way. He asked me my name and my family and all sort of thing, you know, And my father, who I was and what happened to him and all that. Yeah, I told him everything. Do you remember the name or did you in any way hear the name of the person who looked at you? And so when they came to find you, uh, did you have any idea what was going on? Yeah, I know, because what happened was this. There was some incident when they were military, went to recover girls and boys. They used to hide them so they couldn't find them. So and they didn't have enough time to look around. So they came First time they came during the day and, uh, I was not there. I was in the fields, so they told them he's not here. So they went back. They didn't ask any question where he was. So then the guy who told them who I was and they went to him, they said that we couldn't find the the boy there. And because my cousin was my father's cousin was involved. He wanted to find me. So he went to the person who informed them about my me living there. So, um, he, uh he said, go at night. I will be there at that time at night. So they came in at about 9. 3010 o'clock, so one person knocked the door and they didn't know who was. As soon as the door opened, there was a boot sounds of boots, and a lot of people were talking to each other. So then all of a sudden, one of them said, Where is the Muslim boy? So I was upstairs with the, uh they had one of their son sleeping upstairs, So they they came upstairs and they asked, Who's the Muslim boy? So I stood up. Then they brought me downstairs and I was crying. I was nowhere. What was going on? So I was so scared that I didn't want to go with him. So then one of the soldier told my uncle's cousin who was there, and they told him to take it me on one side and tell, Tell me all my background, my family. So then I will be more calm and go with them. So he took me on one side and told me about my father's name and my uncle's name and about the village and all that. So then I was kind of satisfied that he's he knows the family, so he'll be OK to go with. So I went, I went with them to the to Ludhiana. Yeah, there, Uh, because I had a long hair at that time, and, uh, I had, uh, simple clothes. So he went and took me to the barber, cut my hair and bought new clothes for me. So then I would live there for two weeks after Then I was transferred to Pakistan on the whole, in the future camp. Yeah. And where did you live in? Uh, I don't remember. It was, uh, uh where the soldiers were living. They had a, uh, one area reserved for the all the refugees. Uh, who they recovered. They used to stay there. Uh, until the bus was ready. Bus load was ready to transfer to Pakistan. And you know, about the first time when they came to look for you. Who told you that story? How did you find out about that? Because when I came home in the evening at that time, the family talk about it. Oh, and what did you think when you heard them? No, I don't know. As I said, you know, I was too young to know who they were and what they were looking, Why they were looking for me. And because I went to that, uh, tragedy. Uh, what happened? So I was scared. Anyway, I was not sure where somebody would take me and who they are and where they're coming from. Why they're looking for me. Nothing at all. And how did you find out that it was one of the boys from that family who had tipped off that after that? My, uh, father, father's cousin. He told me after that when he recovered me and he told me that's where he phoned me. Uh, that that boy boy came and told him where I was and who I was and all that. So can you describe the journey to the refugee camp? Who were the people that were with you? How did you get there? I, uh when they put us on the bus, I didn't know anybody in the bus. I didn't know anybody out anywhere. And my father's cousin couldn't come with us. because he was in the military. So he got to stay there. So he wrote a letter to my, uh, his cousin, my uncle that I was found and I will be in a refugee camp, but because of the mail so slow they couldn't get it for two months. The later so by the time they got a letter in the meantime, my mother's and brother came and picked me up from there and took me with him to his house in Kaso. Can you describe the refugee camp? It was a huge. It was used to be a jail before with the high walls and big, huge courtyard. And, uh, they emptied the jail and all made a refugee camp. And where was this? What city in Lahore and on Jail Road used to call jail road at that time, That road, so that that's where it was. So where did you sleep and what did you eat? I would sleep on the floor and there was food provided both time, morning and evening. And, uh, that's where it was that where you can II I myself was looking in the food camp that I could find some family members. I could find anybody, so I resolved myself. Well, I don't know what's going to happen now. I was just standing there every day. Did you talk to anyone? Nobody talked to me. I didn't talk to anybody as well. What were the people like from your observation? Oh, everybody was terribly frightened and confused because, uh, all the, uh, people over there, they have lost their family contact and everything. They didn't know where the their families were. All the girls and boys or young girls or older girls, whoever they were. So nobody knew what to do or not to do. And they were waiting for their relatives to come there and find them. That was the only way. There was no contact whatsoever. And nobody knew who survived, who didn't. And I didn't know myself that, uh how many family member or my cousin uncles or anybody? Cousins who survived. Who didn't? I didn't know at that time. What were the general ages of the people? You think the youngest one were around my age 56 year old seven year old, eight year old. And then there were girls about 1516, 18 year old and some older women too. And what was the general mood about? How are people communicating with each other? Not really. Because everybody was so traumatised. Everybody was thinking about their own family own that somebody would come and pick them up. They did tell sort of tragic story to each other. What happened at the time they moved? They were taken from their homes and families. But that was out there to it. Otherwise nobody knew. Do you remember any stories? No, I don't know. And do you remember the day that you were found by my uncle came And what happened? What they used to do was that they when refugee came, they register on the names and family names and where they come from. And so uh oh."}
