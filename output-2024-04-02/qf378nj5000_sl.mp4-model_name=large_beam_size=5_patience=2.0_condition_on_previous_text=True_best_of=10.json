{"text": "My name is Elvira Prieto, I'm a sophomore in human biology here. I'm from Reedley, California, which is a small agricultural town in the San Joaquin Valley. My parents are migrant workers and I've worked in the fields with them all my life up until I started coming to school. My name is Eva Silva, I'm a senior majoring in human biology with an emphasis on education in the diverse classroom. And I'm from Salinas, California, and I'm going to be a math teacher. My name is Tamara Alvarado. I'm majoring in Spanish Chicano studies. I'm from a town in San Diego called Escondido, and um, what else, that's it for now. My name is Julia Gonzalez Luna, I'm a senior majoring in public policy with a focus on education. And um, I'm from Burbank, California. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. And I'm going to be a social worker. I was a social studies high school teacher. Do you wanna ask some questions here as to how this started and how it evolved? In yohan words, how did it start? How did this hunger strike start and why? How did it start? Speak to us as if we don't know. Okay. Speak to minute if we can do it. Well, I guess it was a build up of. a lot of different things that have been happening, not only on this campus, but overall in this nation with the status of Chicanos and Chicanas in the United States, in the universities and everywhere else. So, you know, I guess I can run down like since my freshman year so many things have happened, the closing down of the Office of Chicano Affairs, and then with all the threats, with the budget cuts to the ethnic centers, and just these attacks on the theme houses, on the ethnic centers, and everything else, and then the laying off of Cecilia Burciaga. I mean, everything just like piled on, piled on, and so many things were happening that we said, wait, we need to do something about it, and we need to change what's going on because nothing's happening that we want to, that we want to do. I'm tired. I'm sorry. No, you sound good. Some people wonder why you would need to take a drastic measure like this. Because the administration has been very, whenever we've had like meetings and townhouse meetings or whatever, get-togethers with any of the administrators, we don't get any results that we're happy with. And so it seemed to me like for them to really understand how extreme the situation is on this campus and how extreme things are outside. I mean, I think it was just the way that the people in East Palo Alto are, that it was maybe the only way that they would, I don't know if it would touch their hearts or if they would just stop to think about it or if we could get enough bad press for this university so that they could finally just really think about it. Because otherwise, they weren't paying attention. It was just like everything had to go business as usual, and there seemed to be this idea about hierarchy here that it was from top down, it was what they said first, and then if we could deal with that, if we as students could deal with that, if we as students could deal with that, that would be important. Yeah. Yeah. So that's just what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. deal with what the university wanted well then that was fine and if we couldn't that's too bad because they're at their position because you know they earned it or whatever yeah because meeting after meeting like you didn't get anything concrete from meeting with them every single time it was just okay I'll give you a meeting from 6 to 7 I'll give you a meeting 5 5 30 to 6 or whatever and we've tried their methods we've tried their methods of working things out and their methods are to draw things up for as long as possible in order to not give us things at least you know they may say differently but that's what it feels like and it's ridiculous to have to spend sorry I'm a little bit tired um it's ridiculous to spend so much time just talking and talking about things and you know they're trying to tire us out with just talking so that's what it had to come to and you know when people are not heard you know and this happens in society at large when people are not heard yeah you know I don't know if I want to say abnormal behaviors but you know behaviors that are not normal you know behaviors that are not normal are are what happened and yeah this is not normal you know this is not normal behavior for us to be you know not eating but but you know yeah we like to eat and um you know it just so I emphasize you know why are Chicanos in prison why are Chicanos you know in poverty that's not normal that's not normal for people but because of society that's how we are we've waited long enough for this I mean I know the administration is probably thinking well you know be patient and these changes will happen but we've been patient long enough and you know we've been patient long enough and we've been you know the Chicano Studies major has been it was envisioned back in back in the 70s even the 60s and and we've been waiting since then and it's about time that then we get recognized you know Chicanos are are the biggest are much are coming to be a majority in California and you know maybe even in the whole country after a while but I mean it's about time that our issues get recognized and that that other people just just realize that we're not going to go away and if they don't educate themselves about us then it's just going to be worse for them Julia, you co-authored a really beautiful poem entitled Somos Mujeres. What for you is the significance of having the Chicanos taking the vanguard role in this movement which is really bigger than this campus? For me? I mean For you? I don't know We didn't really realize it was for women until somebody pointed it out to us I don't I mean we knew it was girls but we didn't see it like you know oh you know there's no guys here you know like what's up with the guys but I don't know I mean we have a lot of supporters that are male and maybe they didn't say they're going to go for the long run but they've been you know they're the whole time everybody like has had it has their roles and it's like there's some people that are the negotiators there's people that are security over here there's like everybody has their roles and you know we're not the the most important because if it wasn't for them then you know nobody would be listening to us or whatever and there's other people that have been fasting also like Felipe he's been fasting these three days with us as well and like there's people that committed to three days and others that do one one day cycles to show their support and solidarity. It's true there are a lot of males that are doing really important stuff in terms of really trying you know like with the rest of the women also trying to take care of us and trying to watch out for this and they're just constantly looking out to see what you know what we need or what needs to be done for the whole group and so it's I don't know I don't know that it's specifically a female thing to be fasting or anything like that because everybody everybody really does have their own role and everybody's been really supportive and we're you know we're working together. It just so happened that we're the ones that you know we're the ones that that you know were ready mentally at this time to to fast and you know it just so happens that we're all women. Yeah people are calling us guerrillas and revolucionarias and all that I mean that's that's I mean that's fine. That's fine. That's nice. You know it's really that's really nice but I mean everybody everybody's been revolutionary and you know it's it comes down to like everybody yeah it comes down to like what you're you know I don't want to say your talents because I don't think our talent is to be hungry but but pretty much like everybody has taken on the role that that is best suited for themselves. There's Felipe. There's Felipe. You know of all the things that you could have done of all the actions you could have taken why fasting? Why did you choose to fast? Well it's obviously a really strong statement you know it's something that it's uncompromising and it's something that shows just how serious we are about these issues. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people wait for. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people wait for. They're issues that our fathers, grandfathers, and people wait for. And you know have fought for and we have a responsibility to those ancestors of ours to make sure that those dreams that they had those that vision they had is fulfilled. We can't just you know it may be 20 years 20 30 20 20 years later from the you know the Chicano movement that people think is dead. But it's not dead we're here and we're living and we're the Chicano movement. And Chicana movement. Yeah. Felipe, you've just joined us, but actually you've been with us throughout this whole struggle from the beginning as it was pointed out. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from, and your reflection on this struggle? Sure. My name is Felipe Barragan. I'm a freshman, originally from Los Angeles, California. This struggle, I think for me, it's something that's very important. Because I went to high school in Watts, and a lot of people know what Watts is like. 1965, Watts Rebellion, the Ninety-Two Riots. There I saw issues that the educational system for high school students and Chicanos, Latinos there, wasn't addressing the real issues. Once I came here, I got a taste of it. I got a taste of Chicano studies. And I found out how crucial that was. And I learned a lot. And I think that getting involved with this struggle is important for me to build the processes with which we learn to deal with inner city, to wipe out the marginalization of our people. In terms of your actions, a lot of people are probably thinking that you came here to study, and that you should be in the classroom, not protesting. And so you're making a decision. Because it is a pretty tough university to be at. And there's a lot of demands, and you're kind of out there really taking a big chance. How did you make that decision? See, I guess, like, the main thing is, is, like, I never, like, when I came here, I didn't want to come and just study and go to class. And go back home, study, do my work, and just concentrate on myself. While there's people out there, there's students in the high schools that are getting pushed out of the schools. There's, you know, the farm workers that are getting treated badly. There's kids being born without hands because of the pesticides that they put on the grapes. I mean, I can't just sit and concentrate on my own work and not worry about what's going on. Because, you know, that's my people, that's my parents, that's my family, that's, you know, everybody. I wouldn't be able to live with myself without doing anything about it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself with just thinking about myself and my career and getting straight A's and doing my resumes and stuff like that. I wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, both things can be done. You know, so, like, I think that we're doing this so that, you know, later generations of Stanford Chicanos and Chicanas don't have to do it. Today we had, you know, little Chicanitas and Chicanitos from East Palo Alto come out. And from Avala Folklórico group called Raíces de México. And they came out and they, you know, they came out and supported us. You know, they're just little kids. You know, I don't know, they're probably like from 5 to like 12 maybe. And, you know, the reason we're doing this now and sacrificing our academic times or study hours or whatever. You know, so that they, when they come here, you know, they can focus, you know, on doing the things that they need to do instead of having to struggle so much. I mean, I think it's just like our parents, you know. They struggle so that we don't have to struggle. And we don't, I mean, we don't. Struggle. We're still struggling but at a different level. You know what I mean? We're not, I mean, we don't have to worry. Once we get out of here, we're not going to have to worry about where am I going to get something to eat like before. Or how are we going to pay the bills. We're probably going to have to, you know, we're probably going to be able to pay even our parents' bills. Hopefully. Yeah. Yeah. I think teachers have to go. Teachers have to go. Teachers have to go. But I think it also goes back to the question about where, why did we choose a hunger strike. It's kind of like, you know, we know that our grades are going to suffer from this. And we're not going to graduate with a great GPA, you know, as we could have. And, I mean, it's to show that, I mean, we know that we're capable of doing a work. But we feel so strongly about this that we're willing to do a little bit, you know, worse than everybody else. Because our issues are so important. And, I mean, I think, I don't know if the administration sees that. But I don't know if anybody sees that. But, I mean, you know, I know that I could be a nice student, you know. But, you know, I choose, I choose to better be like, to be a human being first. And to care more about my people than others. And to care more about my people than about my grades. I was going to ask you, you know, related to the incident that happened on Sunday at the Flix, in the film, Notaries of Shoals. How do you, how do you feel, or what steps can the university take to educate the student, the student community, even staff and faculty, about the issue of, you know, ongoing racism. The issue of why it's important to have abandoned grades. On this campus. How do you think the university can take a proactive role in educating the community? I think if they really, truly believe that that isn't right. That the incident at Flix isn't right. Or that people should know and should be, I mean, understand that the pesticides and the harm that they're doing to people is wrong. Then they should take it upon themselves to educate this university. If they really feel responsible for the education of their students. If they really, if they believe that that is an important issue. That people's lives and people's health and the reaction of some or a lot of students finding that amusing. There's something wrong with that. There's something wrong with the mentality or with the ignorance level or something of the students at this university. And they are responsible because they're the administrators. They're in charge of this school. They're here to serve the students. But they're also here to help educate them. And there's, I mean, to me that proved just amazing. Just a lot of ignorance. It didn't surprise me. But it was very offensive. And it was very disrespectful. And if they really, if they agree with that at all, then it's their responsibility to deal with it. I mean, the main things that were, you know, just to bring up what we're striking about. You know, we have these issues that we have been dealing with as a community for a long time. And, you know, one of them being a campus ban on grades. The development of a Chicano studies program. And the community center in East Palo Alto. And, you know, these are things that we can talk about specifically. And the offer for Cecilia Bulciaga. And the offer for a high-level position for Cecilia Bulciaga, a high-level administrator here. Chicano administrator. Why is it important? Why is it important for the university to recognize Cecilia's contributions? Why is Cecilia's position, Cecilia's role included among these other three? Well, basically because it ties down to the whole approach that we're taking. That our education isn't addressing the real issues. You know, the issues being poverty, the joblessness. And... Um... You know, the over-representation we have in the jails. And just everything. And she ties into that because Cecilia has always worked, you know, for those issues. She's always, you know, she was working on the Boycott Grapes campaign. And, I mean, when she gets here, I mean, when she's here, you get here. I mean, she's like a role model. A role model. She's a role mother. Oh, man. I'm getting tired. Um... Oh. No, you're good. What's... Yeah, what we're talking about... No, I'm saying... She's a role... She's a role model and a role mother. Mother figure. Mother figure. That's it. No, I guess basically because she helps in just keeping us here. Because it's hard to survive in a campus like this. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. When you have a campus like this... When you have people, like, Sunday nights at Flix saying Beaners, go home, or, you know, same stuff like that here at Stanford, I mean, how are we supposed to survive in a climate that doesn't even accept us, that you have to justify your existence? You need people like Cecilia Bustiaga and, like, Frances that just help you out, just to make... Like, especially the transition from, like, your first year. I mean, that's what helped me so much, living in Zapata my very first year, is I survive the whole year because i was living there i think because i mean she she helped out a lot like with my parents and just everything i mean i think like they're always caring she's an important important contact for us i mean there's so so few of us here and then there's so few of our you know chicano and chicana role models here that we can you know talk to and say you know hey you know this happened to me today or you know i really it's really strange for me to be here and not be back home where i see a lot of people who look like myself you know and these are people that you can talk to like cecilia you know she's she's i mean i i find it incredible she always has time to hear us out always yeah when um when i was a freshman like i have a really nice story about her that um when i well i didn't for some dumb chance i didn't get to live in zapata my freshman year and so so like i had a lot of problems like just trying to adapt and trying to trying to decide like what i was going to do with my life and i had this whole big problem about deciding whether to be a doctor and secure a good financial future for myself and for my family or do what i really wanted to do is to be a teacher and um um my advice my freshman advisor recommended that i go to her because he had heard so many nice things about her that he thought she could help me and i remember going into her office and just like crying my guts out because i didn't know what i didn't know where i fit into this university and um she talked she had time like she she sat with me in her office and talked to me and encouraged me to do what what i felt was right you know that to let my heart decide and i mean for the university not to be a doctor i didn't know what i was going to do to recognize that she is capable of like keeping me here because i was ready to leave and she she literally made me helped me to stay and if it wasn't for her i mean i wouldn't be here all of you are members of mecha what is um the significance of this new phase and and i'm referring specifically to to the various uh events that started uh ucla uc santa barbara colorado university of colorado and michigan state virginia too and virginia too you talked about this in the context of the overall resurgence of mecha and chicano student activism um i think as mecha is the chicano student movement and there's a long history of activism there dating back to the original planet planet santa barbara and i think that each of us has has um maintained that i that i um that goal of the betterment of la raza and um our mecha is is very strong and we support with those founding mechistas um came up with in terms of the plan santa barbara and um it's gaining it's in ucla and uc santa barbara and other universities mechi members and other um organizations are taking leadership and moving the universities to meet the demands i think it's playing an instrumental role They got misquoted? They're gonna print tomorrow. Are they in support? Yeah we're rolling. That sucks man. I feel bad for lying about it. Let's say it again... I was going to ask you, I know earlier I talked to your dad, and I talked to your mom, and I know from them that it's been really hard for them, I mean, they haven't been eating as well. They're also, in a way, also in the hunger strike. How do you feel about your parents' role in this? How are you going to explain it to your parents once it's over and you haven't really explained it to them? Provide courage and that kind of thing. Well, I told, my biggest worry in terms of deciding to take part in the fast was how my mom was going to take it. Because I thought she was going to, you know, she's an asthmatic and I thought she was going to get sick because any time she stresses out she has really bad attacks and stuff. And I just knew I was going to worry her and I was going to hurt her and that was the thing that scared me the most. But I talked to her about it and I kind of eased her into it. I started telling her first about the plan to stay out of the quarter and stuff like that. And she was like, well, she told me, before I even mentioned to her that I was going to fast, she said, well, Mija, when you are leading, when you are a leader and you want to take part in changing things when they're bad, sometimes you have to make sacrifices. She said, and, you know, whatever happens, you guys, you know, you have my prayers and you have my support. And so then when I told her, she was like, oh, and I guess she maybe understood or was getting, you know, thoughtful. I thought that I was going to get to that. Because I told her and she was like, well, she said, I'm not going to tell you to do it and I'm not going to tell you not to do it because I don't want to feel responsible for you doing it and I don't want to feel responsible for you feeling bad because maybe, you know, it didn't succeed or because you weren't, you know, you really didn't want to do what you wanted to. She said, but I'm really scared. But she said that she had faith in God and as long as I had faith in God that everything was going to be okay. And so for me, it was very empowering because the minute I got off the phone, I decided this is, I really felt like I was going to succeed. I was going to succeed. I was going to talk strongly about it already and I decided that this was something I was going to do. And even though I was going to cause her a lot of pain, that I was going to get through it and that she was going to get through it. And I'm pretty sure that she hasn't been eating either. And I haven't been able to speak with her since that last time I talked to her. But like she told me, she said, you know, she said for herself that she's already past her youth and she doesn't know that she can do that much anymore. And she said, it's our turn. And so here we are. We're trying to make changes because I don't want to, I really don't want my little brother to have to do something like this. And I have a younger sister who's here also and I don't want her to have to, you know, continue this. I mean, she probably won't have to just because that's the way things are around here. But, you know, if I could, if I can help out in some way so that, you know, the kids that come here later don't have to be going through this, then that would be awesome. So, yeah. I have a question. How has the university administration... I'm sorry. Okay. Do you want to go? Yeah. Okay. I guess that was the hardest thing for me as well. It's like I knew, like when we thought of the idea, I knew that I wanted to do it. I wanted to be part of the hunger strike. I just knew that I could do it and I was going to have the willpower to go through with it. But the only thing was my mom. I didn't know how to tell her. I didn't know what to tell her. I was scared. Because I know that the way my mom is, she worries and she doesn't sleep at night and she can't eat and it's just, it's bad. I hate it. I don't like doing that to her because she still works and she's getting older and everything. But, I don't know, it's just something I felt so deep from my heart. I just thought, you know, so many people are going to gain a lot from this. So many people are going to, you know, have a lot of things come out of this, especially like with the East Palo Alto Community Center and with the boycott on the graves. It's just immediate, like, help for people that are practically, that are dying and, you know, being born with birth defects. So, when I told her, you know, she was telling me, you know, she didn't want me to do it. She was telling me I'm anemic, that I was anemic. Then my dad told me I had a low red blood cell count. They were just coming up with all these things that I had that I shouldn't be doing. That I shouldn't be doing it because I was so skinny and I was going to disappear and this and that. So then, um, oh, sorry. So then, um, after, oh, when I told her, I mean, it was really hard. She was crying and everything. And then I called her after the first day of the hunger strike. And she couldn't talk to me because she didn't want to cry on the phone. So that, that just made me, I was just crying. I was talking to my sister. And my sister was, you know, I was telling her, tell my mom that I'm not hungry. Tell her that I'm feeling good. The issues are keeping me alive. And they're going to keep me alive. And I'm going to be okay. So, um, but she's going to come today because she's, she's worried. And she wants to see me. Well, uh, the hardest part of this whole thing was just to, to tell my mom and dad, you know, that I was going to do this. Because, like, we've all said, you know, we don't want to make them, you know, we don't want to make them suffer. But, uh, I told her and she said, um, you know, okay, well, if you guys are still out there after three days, then I'm going to come out. And then the right, like, a few minutes before I left, I was talking to her. Y me estaba dando la bendición. Do I have to translate that? Oh, okay. And then, um, and then, um, so, you know, she was, she was crying and I could tell. And she was giving me the bendición. And so she was like, you know what? I'll be out there tomorrow and stuff. And, you know, my mom and dad got some money together. And then, so my mom could fly out here and stuff. And, um, so she, she came out last night. And, I mean, I think it was better for her to come because she, you know, she was upset when she saw me. She was crying and stuff. But, you know, she's been really good. And everybody's been really supportive of her. And she's been, I think it makes her feel good to feel useful to this, to this thing. She feels a part of, a part of this strike. And, you know, she feels a part of the movement. And, you know, I think that, you know, she is. Because, you know, we're fighting, I'm fighting for her and for everybody. And, um, you know, she slept out there with us last night. So, she's hardcore. Um, for me, that, that was definitely the hardest part. Because, and after I did it, I was, I wished that I didn't, that I didn't have to. But I know that I, that if I hadn't, it would have been worse for her. If she had found out some other way. So, um, I'm just really worried about her. Because she has heart problems. And, um, I was afraid that if she saw me on the news or something, that, you know, . You know. And that everything would be worse. But, but, you know, she's fine. And, and she already told me that she supports me. And, and even though it's the, the hardest thing, you know, for her. Like, she knows, I told her that it was her who taught me how to fight. And, maybe that, hopefully that made her feel a little bit better. But, maybe, hopefully, I don't know. I don't know exactly how she is. Uh, last time I talked to her, she sounded very weak. And, um, my dad called me, like, the next morning, the morning after I told my mom. And he tried his hardest to convince me not to do it. He, he told me all kinds of things. And he told me, why do you want to, why do you want to go through another hunger after you've suffered so many hungers. So many hungers in your life. And just reminding me of all the things that I've had to go through just to get where I am. And trying to tell me, well, don't, you know, don't do it. But, I still did it. And he's here right now. And he came and told me, he's still trying to convince me to stop. Because he goes, he says, you know, your mom's going to come up here tomorrow. And if you're still on the strike, she's going to strike with you. So, I don't know. Um, I think, generally, my parents, um, have the same feelings. As all the others do. Um, but it's a little bit easier for them to handle. Because tonight's going to be my last day fasting. So, that's basically it. Last word, Nicole? Um, well, okay. You said it's for historical purposes, right? So, when, um, you know, 20 years from now, when other Chicanos look at this, you know. And Chicanas. And Chicanas. Sorry. I'm tired. Um, you know. I hate to see this. Um, just to remember that, you know, even when you're looking at this now, 20 years later, the movement is still alive in you. And we still have to keep struggling. Because, you know. Well, hopefully, we can stop. Hopefully, we can stop some of it. But, I mean, if it's still, if it's still bad, you know, 20 years from now, you know, we can do it, you know. Yeah. And don't take advantage of what, you know, what you have. Of what you have. Because, like, for us, it's very important to say, oh, we have, we have el centro. And there's a lot of people that worked hard for it. Don't settle for what you have. Don't settle for what you have. And don't forget us, pretty much. Don't forget the people who fought before you. All the things, like, the people that fought before us. And before us. And before them. And just remember we're, you know, we're doing this for you. For the future. For the youth. I feel like I'm just farting right now. . My name is Chuck. Oh, okay. But the new message is this. What's the big room? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It is currently about 7.30 on the 6th of May, Friday, 1994. We have just collected, witnessed the five testimonials from five of the hunger strikers, which have included at one point over 100 Solidarity strikers. At this time, we have received the latest response from the administration, which has been recalcitrant up to this point. I understand that there are still many points that need to be reviewed and some more dialogue that needs to take place, but at the moment, it looks as though the statement that we have made as a community, the Chicano community, and the statement that comes from various communities throughout the Bay Area and the nation in solidarity with us. Thank you. The statement that we have made has begun to open the administration's eyes to the justness of our cause and our demands. However, as I said, there still is some work to be done. For the moment, it seems as though our first demand, that is the offering of a high-level position to Associate Dean Cecilia Bursiaga, is still not being met. As I said, this was our first demand, and it is very important to us. some more negotiation has to go on with regards to that. The second demand involves the establishment of a community center in East Palo Alto to serve the community that literally works to preserve the functioning of this university. And as far as the administration is concerned, they are receptive to the initiative that the Chicano and Chicana students have presented in terms of bridging the gap between the community and the academy. This has been a very important component to the struggle here. As a matter of fact, this is a component that isn't new. It goes all the way back to the Plan de Santa Barbara, which inaugurated MECHA. So we are very hopeful that... some breakthrough will come through here. As regards to the Chicano and Chicana studies, again, this is the justness and the feasibility of this demand has led the administration to also give overtures that are encouraging. Finally, the issue of grapes on campus and specifically the negative reactions, the racist reactions to our efforts to educate the community. The community at Stanford has, in our protest, our protest against those negative reactions has led the university to embark upon an initiative to educate all the dorms through the showing of the No Grapes video and also through establishing a dialogue with our community, the Chicano community, in an effort to bridge the gaps that have been... caused... bridged the divisions that have been caused by the racism that's very often a result of an academy which is very hierarchical and one which is institutionally and structurally hostile to the presence of minorities and other marginalized people. With this, I would just like to say, Que viva la raza y adelante. We're going to win this one.
